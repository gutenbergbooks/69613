<h3>THE THREE GAUNT MEN</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, Master of Logie, came swinging
up the last of the stiff miles that climbed from
Norbrigg market-town to the high uplands.
October’s mists had lain heavy on the lowlands, but
here on the tops he strode into sunlight and clean,
nipping air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grim and lean, toughened by many sorts of weather,
Hardcastle paused to get breath again, and looked out
across the lonely acres that stretched to the four
quarters of a blue and amber sky. Ahead of him,
bordering the roadway, he saw the straggling clumps
of houses known as Weathersett. A brave, storm-battered
village, keeping watch above the mines that
once fed its people, it wore a comrade’s look to Hardcastle.
So did the barren pastures, roaming out and
over between their grey stone fences to the gateways
that gaped across the hill-tops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts were busy with all that lay hidden in
these broken lands—unfenced mines, their waters
brimming deep—caves, wandered through in boyhood,
that had set their spell of mystery and dread on all his
after life. It was a haunted land, as all folk knew,
and in its old mine-workings lurked trolls and ancient
goblins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His glance roamed down to another village—not
reared high like Weathersett, but skulking in a lowland
hollow on the far side of the benty waste. He forgot
trolls and all their phantom kindred. They were
unsubstantial, but the people who lived there in
Garsykes village were flesh and blood and a standing
menace to the country-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange look stole across Hardcastle’s face.
Contempt, antagonism, the shadow of some restless
fear, followed each other as he stood watching Garsykes;
for distrust of its folk had been in his mother’s
milk, and in the tales passed down for generations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had many by-names, like all tribes greatly
feared. Men of the Wilderness, some called them;
others the Broken People, or the Lost Company.
Names of that sort were no more than wind in the
reeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stark truth remained that Garsykes village was
the abiding-place of every rogue about the fells. Sheep
stealers had foregathered there since time out of mind—men
who had done murder on the high fells—lesser
rogues who had snatched purses at village fairs, and
come breathless from pursuit. Such pursuit ended
always on the verge of Garsykes, for none but vagabonds
dared enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle remembered his father’s downright
struggle against the tribute these Lost Folk levied on the
country-side. They were a small village then, but had
grown big on what they fed on, till nowadays even
strapping farmers paid toll for a safe home-coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle swung down the road till a turning of the
way showed him suddenly the whole, wide front of the
highlands that stepped out to his own Logie country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pengables caught the mellow sunlight, and his rocks
were softened till they showed like some misty castle
seen in dreams. The brackens were on fire, and slender
rowans crimsoned up to the wise, stalwart pines that
fringed the moor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a man’s land, wide, free-striding, its
shoulders pushing up to freedom and the sky. It had
fathered and mothered his orphaned life. He knew
its every dell and furrow, and from the heart of it
a crisp, sweet breeze ran out in greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went down the lone track—past Drumly Ghyll,
where Riding Nevison had leaped his horse from
cliff to cliff in half-forgotten days—and came to the
bend that showed Langerton below him, a hamlet
clustered round its water-mill. He could almost hear
the mill-wheel droning—a goblin that toiled underground,
to his awed boyish fancy—a goblin still,
though manhood had killed many pleasant, eerie fears
of that sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, not knowing why, halted in his stride,
and stood looking out across the waste. If the hills
were brown and steadfast washed by rain and sun,
below him lurked the mines, the bogs that sucked a man
down, dragging at him till limb by limb the chill ooze
chained him. And there were the Wilderness Men,
whose enmity was a dread thing to earn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stab of fear took him unawares as if one of the
Stealthy People had crept on him from behind. He
shook it off, telling himself that the dread was part of
his heritage of Logie. A grown man must learn to
shake off nursery tales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swart, russet face of the land, crowned by
Pengables, stood friend to him as he went down the
twisting road; and it was in his heart to clear these
lusty acres of the scum that hindered them. It was in
his heart still when he came past Mathison’s pinfold,
where in summer they gathered flocks for sheep
washing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the pinfold came three gaunt men, and straddled
across the road, barring it to him. They were unwashen,
shifty folk to look at, and they asked tribute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I owe none,” said Hardcastle, with rough contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re Wilderness Folk,” said Long Murgatroyd,
the tallest of the three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again fear played about the Master of Logie, from
long habit—played for an instant, and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much would content you?” he asked, as if
willing to drive a sober bargain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As much as you’ve got,” snarled Murgatroyd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle was beginning to see red, dancing lights
between the gaunt men and himself, was ceasing to
count the odds. “You shall have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three leered at each other. “What did I tell
you?” asked one of them. “Nobody dare touch the
Master of Logie, we said. Oh, we’d best go wide of the
Master, we snivelled. But he’s frog-livered too, like
the rest of his dalesmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle backed quietly to the open gateway of
the pinfold, and stood in front of it. He had room to
swing his arms, and the three must come at him one at
a time or not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, take all I’ve got of muscle,” he said. “It’s
waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lost Folk were happier when they fought in
numbers against few; but now the biggest of the three
saw, too, the red, dancing lights and made at Hardcastle.
The bleak, well-matched fight went this way
and that. Neither spared nor hoped to be spared.
The world was narrowed to the limit of blows that
thudded out into the breeze. Then Hardcastle swept
his left arm round, as it might have been a hammer, and
his man went down, and lay still, and cursed no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master of Logie had given tribute, enough and
to spare. His face was wealed and broken, his body
hammered out of shape. The men left were wondering
how to take him—for the pinfold wall would not let
both make at him together—when Hardcastle settled
all doubts for them. Fury was on him now. He
sprang forward before they guessed his purpose,
gripped them with either hand and brought their heads
together with a dizzy crash. He stood a moment
looking at them as they lay beside Long Murgatroyd,
and wondered at his strength. Then he went down
the road, with a song at his heart. Whatever stoop to
pride the dalesmen made each market day when they
paid tribute, the pride of Logie went secure.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle halted by and by, for a backward glance
at the Wilderness, and still the glow of victory was with
him. Battle was up in earnest now between Logie and
the Broken Folk. There could be no withdrawal,
whichever way it ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A terrible land for thieves, Master,” said a quiet
voice at his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle turned sharply, to find his own shepherd,
Brant, beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Stephen, you’re wide of the home pastures—and
you’ve a gun for company, instead of a stick and a
grizzled collie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Short, thick-set and sturdy, Brant had the eyes of
those who journey on far hill-tops, living alone with
sheep and dogs and weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve heard of Storm’s doings lately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“News filters through, but I’ve little use for gossip—especially
of friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, you were always partial to Storm, and I fair
loved the dog myself. Best of his kind, he was—knew
how to round ewes up the pastures like a marvel—till
he fell from grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We all do, Stephen, time and time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re partial to him, as I said. But a dog that
takes to worrying sheep, and feeding on ’em, is a
cannibal—eats his own flesh-and-blood, as you might
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You trained him to be jealous, Brant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shepherds do. A dog that’s any man’s dog means
as much as a bunch of windle-straws.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I could always whistle him from your side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” growled the shepherd— “and see what
comes of it. A sheep-stealer, he, and me with a gun
in my hands. That’s what is coming to Storm, for I’ve
news of him this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then likely he’s back in the Logie country by this
time. Either way, bad luck to your shooting,
Stephen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There seems bad luck to your riding, Master,”
said the shepherd dryly, “or you’d not be footing it
from Norbrigg. It’s not natural, like, to see you
without feet in stirrups.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mare went lame, and I had to leave her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there no nag to be borrowed, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was, but I sit astride my own horse, or none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant looked over the wastes, then at the Master’s
face. Old days and new were nagging at him with
their memories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like yourself, and always a little bit liker as the
years pass. What of Garsykes yonder?” he broke off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” asked Hardcastle, blunt and hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no way well. A festering sore I call’m, and
our farmers tame as lice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tamer. They haven’t a bite at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence came to Brant. He had dared to speak of
the Lost Folk, here in the broken lands, and suddenly
he remembered boyhood’s days. When he was spoiling
for mischief, he was told he’d be tossed to the Wilderness
Folk, and never come out again. In later years
he had heard his elders speak of paying tribute to the
Lost People—<span class='it'>lest worse befell</span>. And now the old
stealthy menace seemed to creep about him as his
glance sought the broken lands again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil take us, Master,” grumbled Brant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s likely he will, all in good time—but why just
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant scratched his wiry beard and pondered. Hill
silences had taught him to be wary of speech when
deep-hidden feelings sought outlet. “Because we’re
content to let this shame go on,” he said at last. “It’s
hard to unravel, this fear of the Lost Folk. I’m small
myself, but most of our men—yeomen, and hinds, and
what not—could make a meal of any two such lean
swine as they breed Garsykes way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet they don’t, Brant. They just unfasten their
pockets and give tribute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be asking tribute of you one day soon,”
said the shepherd, after another restless silence. “And
what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>They’ve asked it</span>, Stephen. Hadn’t you seen my
face was a trifle out of shape?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’d seen; but it was not my place to ask what
private diversion you’d been finding Norbrigg way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle laughed outright at Brant’s gravity, that
hid a dry humour of its own. “I gave more than I took,
Stephen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then a bonny mess t’others must be in. Who
were they, Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long Murgatroyd and two I didn’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fire kindled suddenly in the shepherd’s eyes. “It
<span class='it'>had</span> to come, and I’m glad its come. Garsykes gets
past itself these days!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many will stand for Logie, now the feud’s up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me for one, and another here and there. I wouldn’t
count on many—but it’s the staunch few that matter—and,
Master, fear will reach you by and by. Never
heed it though it will be cold as east wind before the
snows come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear?” said Hardcastle, body and heart aglow with
memory of blows taken and given for Logie’s honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, just fear. I’ve heard my fore-elders talk of
what happens to a man that thwarts the Lost Folk.
And now I’ll give you good-day. It’s time I put a
dollop of lead into Storm. It would rankle when my
time came to go, if I’d left a sheep-killer rife about the
fells.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>For a mile or so after leaving Brant the glow of
victory stayed with Hardcastle; and after that he
thought that his feet began to tire. Soon he knew it
was his heart that was tiring, and his spirit. Already
fear was weaving unclean spells about him. What
had his nurse told of the Lost Folk when they put their
token on a man? What had ancient farmers told
him? He was no longer his own master but thrall to
terrors bred in the womb of generations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fancy began to play strange tricks. Hardened to life
and weather he might be; but he was no match for the
unseen hordes of fear that came about him. The sweat
broke out on Hardcastle, fighting longer odds than
three men against one. It was only shame of his fear
that got some sort of manhood into him, and a rough
courage that was friendless and utterly alone. He
learned then what Brant had meant when he spoke of
dread, cold as east wind with snow behind it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” growled Hardcastle, “but Brant has his
dog with him for comfort, and I’ve none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He forgot that Brant’s dog had taken lately to
unlawful ways, till at a corner of the road he came face
to face with Storm himself—an outlaw, every inch and
line of him, standing at bay. His hide was matted and
uncouth, for pursuit had given him little time to tend
himself. His teeth were bared, and every man his foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood there for a moment, not knowing that
the whole Dale’s safety might rest on what came of this
chance meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm,” said Hardcastle, “I’ve no fear of your
teeth, my lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The culprit only growled, till Hardcastle came to him
and patted his tousled head. Then he yielded a little
to old liking for this man who seemed honest, with no
snare in wait for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Best come home with me to Logie. Brant has a
gun in his hand out yonder, and he’s seeking you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm glanced about him with restless eyes that
looked for peril, and then sought Hardcastle’s face
again. If he had not learned the trick of human
speech, he knew its meaning. He was asked to get
into shelter of a decent homestead, after weeks of
vagabond roaming. His limbs were full of aches,
caught in the marshes when he lay hidden from foes
too many for him. He was wearied-out, and there
were good meals to be had at Logie, as he had learned
in the prosperous times when Brant used to take him
to the Master’s kitchen. But he was afraid of houses
these days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” said Hardcastle, with sharp command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep-slayer answered his bidding, and together
they went down and up to the autumn land till they
reached Logie Brigg. Its arch stretched wide and
slender over the peat-brown waters of Wharfe River—the
bridge that Clifford of Skipton had crossed long
ago on his way to Flodden Field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master of Logie could never cross the bridge but
he halted for remembrance of what it meant to him—that
old dream of Clifford, hale at sixty, going into
unknown hardship across the Border. The Hardcastle
of that day, with his men, had joined the march, and
won renown; and to this last descendant of the race
there was staunch, abiding glamour in the recollection.
Hard, embittered, working grimly forward day
by day, two beacon-lights showed through the gloom—love
of Wharfe River, and memory of Clifford jangling
over-bridge with singing Dalesmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had no joy of these to-day, strive as he might to
capture the song of Logie Brigg. Courage had taken
the horsemen and the footmen over, in the brave days
gone. Now he was here—a Hardcastle last of them all—eating
into mind and heart—fear of the Lost Folk he
despised. He had given too much to the battle at
Mathison’s pinfold and the back-rush of it left him
weak and spent. The Lost Folk would strike soon or
late—strike from behind—and it would be a dreary
waiting time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm,” he said, “there’s not a penny to choose
between us. We’re both of us outlawed, and we fear
every creak of a tree-branch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep-stealer would not have it so. He had the
dog’s instinct for what went homeward over Logie
Brigg, unheard by Hardcastle—tramp of the feet of
Flodden Men, returning to the house of Logie now
it was in peril. He turned to see them pass; a
great company. Then he drew closer still to Hardcastle,
and licked his hands, and tried to lick his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a dreamer, lad,” said Hardcastle. “How
can all be well—with <span class='it'>that</span> behind us? There’s Brant
with a gun for you—and for me the Wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm only came the closer. On the high fells he
had learned the tracks of innocence and duty. In the
lowlands he had garnered stealthy knowledge of many
ways of hide-and-seek. Through clean days and
muddy he had kept one gift safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fell silent on the Brigg, these two. Wharfe
River lapped against the sturdy arches she had tried,
time and again, to batter down at flood-time. They
heard rooks calling from peaceful sycamores, the cry
of a plover not gone south as yet, the song of a farm-lad
up the fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this might be with him to the end of his days,
thought Hardcastle. But it was likelier that all would
go, before the Wilderness had done with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d best be jogging,” he said, turning up hill,
Storm close as a thistle-burr beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle was aware of the magic of this steep,
winding roadway, faring up to his own gate between
the woods of Logie. Wise, silent beeches reddened
to their fall of leaf. A chestnut flung its crimson
challenge to the death-in-winter soon to come. The
sycamores were sending little clouds of leaves as
playthings for the breeze. Over all, and through all,
was the quick reek of autumn and the smell of wood-fires
lazing up from Logie’s hearths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle was aware of it all, as of something that
had stirred him once, in his wooing days, when a lass
had painted all the country-side for him. That was
far off, a memory bitten-down and ended. He was
here with Storm, with thoughts of what the Lost Folk
could do to him and his. The battle up-fell had put
its marks on him. He was hungry and needing wine
at his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For all that, when they passed through Logie’s gate
and his old retriever growled at Storm—when the two
of them were for each other’s throats, mad with sudden
jealousy—Hardcastle took them by their collars, and
shook them till they whimpered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s going to be war outside,” he said; “but,
by God, I’ll have peace among my own.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap02'>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<h3>CAUSLEEN</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A red sun was going down behind the rim of
the far-off hills as Pedlar Donald came to
the road-top overlooking Logie Woods, and
beyond them the leagues of moorland roving up into
the quiet and misty dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shifted the heavy pack from his shoulders, and
laid it down awhile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired, father?” asked the girl beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald Cameron answered nothing for awhile. He
came from Highland glens and moors; and all the
way south his yearning for the homeland had dragged
at his feet as if they were shod with stone. He had
bartered and sold in “foreign” lands, right down
through the Scottish lowlands, and over the border
into Northumberland and Durham. Now he could
not be done with looking out and over these blue-purple
hills—fold on fold of them, glamoured like his
misty Highlands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl had fallen silent, too. This land was
setting its spell on her, as on Donald—the first friendly
face they had found in exile. She had ached and
sorrowed for the land left behind. And now it was
with her—strength of the striding hills—the sun
going down in fire of hope for the next morrow’s
rising—the wide, free liberty of this land of Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve travelled the rough ways down from
Inverness,” said Donald, putting his arm about the
girl, “and it’s been hard for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, but for you.” Her voice was soft and
healing. “My feet are young to the roads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it worth while to say no to the price they
offered us in Inverness? We could have had ease
for the asking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soft voice grew full of quick and eager fire.
“We could have bought ease—and we’re better as
we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald laughed quietly as he shouldered his pack
and trudged down the hill. The lass was bone of
his bone, and had no regrets. Sharing honest exile,
they had learnt the strange alchemy of the Pedlar’s
Road that turns much bitterness to gold. A laugh
by the wayside here, a vigil there with stricken folk—no
taxes asked of their poverty, and none to deny
them wind and weather—it was a big life, after all,
open to the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only when they came to Logie Brigg, and Donald
felt his knees grow weak again, so that he had to
rest awhile, he doubted the wisdom of their days
together. He was old and tiring fast. What of his
girl if he died by the way? There was honour of
the Road, and she would not lack many friends among
the pedlars and the cheery tinkers and the men who
poached fat hares by night. True—but there were
perils for a maid who went alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” he said, as they rested on the bridge and
heard Wharfe River croon and swirl below them, “it’s
a vagabond’s life, after all—and, Causleen, I’m weary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your mother seems very near to us,” said Donald,
his head lifted as if he heard the pipes calling him up
some far hill. “There was the night she was dying,
and you a week-old baby in her arms—how clear it
all returns—and she saw that I hated you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hated?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you robbed me of a wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm the sheep-stealer had seen ghosts of armed
men pass to and fro across the Brigg, no longer since
than yesterday. These two were seeing the broken
years behind them, the slow growing into a comradeship
as strong as the hills that guarded Logie Brigg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She put you into my arms,” went on the pedlar
by and by, “and bade me christen you Causleen.
I fear I was rough with you, lass.” The old, whimsical
humour showed in his tired eyes. “Your mother
chided me gently—taught me how to hold you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again she bade me name you Causleen, because
you’d be the Evening Star to me. She was near
to death, and knew—what I came to know—that you’d
be the light of my westering years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A grief too deep for tears came to the girl. Some
weakness in the pedlar’s brave old voice—his looking
backward, though all his sturdy gospel was to front
the hills of each day—as they came—his hard endeavour
to get the pack jauntily over his shoulders
once again—all pointed the one way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the bridge in silence, each knowing
that they journeyed to a new life. It might be
worse or better than the old. They did not know;
but, either way, it was a stage nearer to the end
of this life’s climb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they went up the road, a light blinked out at
them from Logie house across the last glow of twilight
that lingered on the hills above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be a bed for the night up there,” said
Donald,—“a bed for you with the maids.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the hay-mow for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s worse lying. You needn’t fret, bairn.
Smell of the hay is no bad company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were not born to it, father,” she said, her
slim, young body shaken with passion—not for
herself, but for him, fuller of courage than strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, but we were, for we’ve come to it, Causleen.
Life’s made that way. The road we trudge, with
its ups and downs—it’s the long, grey road we were
meant to tread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was himself again, and the girl’s mood yielded
to this indomitable, half-laughing courage that would
not be dismayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the grey road end somewhere?” she asked,
linking her arm in his to help him up the steep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust not. When my time comes to go, there’ll
surely be other hills beyond the Brink—winding
roads, and further rises, and gloaming skies. I’d
be lonely without them, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to the grey house on the hill, through
a rain of beech-leaves slanting down the breeze. The
pedlar’s glance, quick for big things and little, caught
a glint of the after-light on a small, polished thing
that lay on top of the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Wilderness Folk told no lies as we passed
through,” said Donald. “I had speech with two or
three, and their talk was all of this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Causleen, peering down at
the thing lying in the old man’s palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a token—and I’m wondering what sort of
man lives here at Logie. He’ll need to be dour and
staunch, with no fear about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were kind enough to us, those folk,” she
said, shivering a little at the memory; “but they
were evil. While we were selling from the pack,
and till we got away into the hills, there was poison
round us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was. It’s a pity, girl, we haven’t let life
dull the Highland vision. We ought to be toughened
by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she glanced at the little thing in his palm.
“Does it go hard with the man they hate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It goes so hard that I’d not change places with
him for a wealth of money. Weather is weather;
fight in the open is fight; but what they’re putting
on the Master of Logie would chill me to the bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dog barked suddenly, then came at them with
a low, running growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be quit of your nonsense, laddie,” said Donald.
“I’ve been through worse fights than you can give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog smelt them round and about to learn
more of these tattered strangers, then put his nose
into the pedlar’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His sort were always friendly to us,” laughed
the girl—“but what of his master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s here to answer for himself,” said Hardcastle
of Logie, turning at his own door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw a big, loose-built man, with a gun under
his arm, and a brace of partridge in his left hand—a
man, Donald judged, accustomed to live alone,
resenting all intrusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come to heel, Roy,” snapped Hardcastle. “I’ve
no use for a dog that makes easy love to strangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen’s pride took fire, and her glance met his
with sharp hostility. “Dogs have clearer sight than
their masters sometimes—and gentler breeding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s getting old, and forgets that gentleness and
breed are under the harrow these days. You’ve
blundered into a hard country, and I tell you so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned from him with tired disdain. “Come
away, father,” she said. “They are surly here in
Yorkshire. He will not buy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you to sell?” asked the Master of
Logie, aloof and cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Favours for the maids,” said the pedlar, his
voice soft with persuasion. He was thinking of
Causleen’s safe lodging for the night, as he opened
his pack and praised its wares. She was too tired,
poor wean, to journey further, though he was so
used to weariness that a further tramp through the
night was of small account. “Favours for the maids—a
blue mob-cap that sits bonnie enough on a young
girl’s hair, with her eyes bo-peeping under it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No maids live at Logie. There’s a grey, old
woman indoors—a good cook, and quiet about the
house—but she’s past favours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re wrong,” persisted Donald. “If a woman
neared her end at ninety, she’d cry for the pedlar
to dress her up for bridegroom death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not Rebecca,” said Hardcastle. “I chose her
with great care—a nether-millstone of a woman,
without a frill or a furbelow about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know much of women?” asked Causleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough to last me a lifetime.” Something cold
and savage showed in his face for a moment, then was
gone. “My housekeeper is like the walls of Logie—staunch
and weathered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She never loses temper?” The girl was measuring
swords with this self-secure, blunt man who disdained
all pedlars. “You never find her crying her heart
out when you come home before she looks for
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She loses temper,” said Hardcastle, with lazy
unconcern. “Not every day, or every week, but
when the time comes for outlet. I’m made that
way myself. We treat it like the ding of storm about
a house that’s outlived many such.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she never weeps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She forgot the way of it long since. Life’s salt
enough for most of us as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s leave him with this wonder-woman, who
never cries,” said the girl, with the same quiet
mockery. “She wants nothing from us and the
Master of Logie will not buy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle stood watching them with grim humour.
“He would, if you’d anything to sell he needed.
Pedlars have to carry all things in their packs for
the women. They seldom have the man of the house
to reckon with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seldom,” Donald agreed; “but I’ve something
to barter for a night’s lodging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wheedling tongue? That never carried far
with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something I found on your gate. Gossip blows
down all winds to us tramping folk, and they say
the Wilderness People grow busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master was silent. For a moment Causleen,
as she watched him, saw beyond the mask of his hard,
impassive face—saw down into his heart, where fear
was dwelling—grey, chilly fear, at war with his manhood
and his lusty strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve left their token on me? Show it,” he
said, with rough command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the price of a night’s lodging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can have it, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so hasty. It must be good lodging for my
girl, however it goes with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master glowered down at them from under
sullen brows. “I’ve power to take it without price
of any sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have—but not power to use your strength
against an aged man. Your face tells me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, your price is granted—a good lodging
for the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For both?” asked Causleen. “Father cares
little what bed he finds—but I care for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beggars seem to be choosers these days,” snapped
Hardcastle, raw with trouble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does seem so,” said Donald gently. “The
beggars out there are riding on your gate already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened his palm, and the moonlight glinted on
a flint arrow-head, smooth and polished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do as he would, something near panic took the
Master. The men of Logie-side had paid tribute
diligently—till yesterday, when at last it was asked
of a Hardcastle and met with blunt refusal. The
fight at the pinfold had marked him. He was lame
and bruised, but that was the pleasant fruit of
victory in single combat against three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing he looked on now was a token hedged
about with dread of the forefathers. Once, in the
twilight days of the Logie country, a man of the caves
had killed his enemy with it, or had slain a wild-fowl
for daily food. Since then it had grown to be what it
was to Hardcastle—a thing of stark terror, known to all
since the Lost Folk first bit their way into an honest
country. He would have been less than flesh-and-blood
if he had not weakened to this harsh trial time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They find such in the caves behind their houses,
they tell me,” said Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and lay them on the gates of honest men.”
Hardcastle had come to grips with fear, as he had
closed yesterday with the three men at the pinfold;
but dread was a harder foe to meet. As he advanced
it withdrew its phantom regiment, only to loose
another on him from behind—quick, cold shapes
that leaped on him and clung. This was the price
asked of him for keeping Logie’s honour safe. He
had given no tribute to the Lost Folk—would give
none in the future—and already the creeping stealth
of their revenge was with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a bleak thing to have at your door for ever,
this hate of the Wilderness Men?” said Donald,
watching him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, whatever he was feeling, shut a trapdoor
on it. His face was grim again, inscrutable.
“A bleak thing, pedlar—but then I was reared on
winter gales.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was aware, by some hidden gift that came
to him at times, of much that was to come about
the house of Logie. “This gale from the Wilderness
is like to blow for a longish while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll have to weather it for a longish while,
and so much for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something stirred in Causleen’s heart against her
will. Hardcastle had given them a churlish welcome.
He did not want them at his door, asked only to
be rid of them; but resentment was dulled, because
she had seen the sudden weakness of his fear, his
hard recovery. She, too, had known the broken
roads, the dread that walked by night. She, too,
had made, day in and day out, her own hard recovery.
They had this in common, she and the Master of
Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A clank of pattens sounded from the stable-yard,
breaking a silence heavy with the sense of doom,
and old Rebecca came into their midst, a lean, tall
figure of a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jacob, the farm-boy, said there was a pedlar
here,” she croaked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is,” said Donald, and in a twinkling unfastened
his pack and laid its wares out in the moonlight
that rode high and clear above the russet beeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca could not be done with handling them—took
up an apron here, a piece of lace-work there,
all as if her youth returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m too old for such-like trash, pedlar, though
God knows I like the feel of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too old? I shouldn’t have guessed it,” purred
Donald. “You’ve no mirror in the house, maybe,
to cure you of that fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put a mob-cap into her hands—a cunning thing
of lavender, simple enough till a woman’s eye
appraised all the little by-ways of its blandishment.
Against her will, the years fell away from Rebecca.
She hid her grey, scanty locks beneath the cap—donned
a lavender apron to match it—and was away
in dreamland, a lass of twenty waiting for her man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a good dream while it lasted; but she wearied
of it, and searched restlessly among the strewn litter
of the pack till she chanced on odds and ends of baby-wear—a
pair of shoes, the two of them small as the
hollow of a man’s hand, and the little intricate clothes,
with daft blue ribands, threaded in and out about
them. All they meant crept round her, and tears
unshed too long found outlet. Donald heard the
great broken heart of life find voice. He was himself
a broken man, and knew. Rebecca came out of that
weakness with a temper raw as a file. “Pedlars are
seldom fools,” she snapped, “but you’re the primest
that ever stepped into Logie-side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I done?” asked Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve bared sorrow to the bone, when I thought
I’d done with grief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, looking on, felt once again that the end
of an old life, the beginning of a new, had come to
them—to tired Donald, and herself. The moonlight,
racing between dappled clouds, shone free above
the beeches on Rebecca—on Hardcastle, grim and
silent. From under Logie Bridge, far below them,
Wharfe River sang her slumber-song as she swept
between her high, grey arches. Roy, the old retriever
that had snarled at them, was fidgetting about the
Master, and whined as if he scented peril. All was
stealthy trouble, though owls were hooting tranquilly
across the woods, and rooks cawed fitfully through
the soft storm of leaves that was baring their spring
nests to sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the best cure,” said the pedlar gently—“the
best for any sort of wound. Let fresh air into
it, though the knife grits down to the bone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca stood there, tall and lean. In her eyes was a
smouldering fire that Causleen and the pedlar understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you’re no fool after all. I’ve let fresh air
into a grief that was festering inward, and praise
the dear God for that. They say you met three of
the Lost Folk yesterday,” she went on, turning to
Hardcastle after a restless silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three at the pinfold—yes. They took tribute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not of the sort they asked?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not of the sort they asked,” snarled Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now again Causleen knew that she had come
into a haunted country and to a haunted house. They
were sorrowing for their dead, slain foully, Rebecca
and the Master—were tending some feud-fire kindled
generations since—and the girl was wrapt away to
the Highlands, where pipes were playing gallantly
about the hills and moaning in the glens of slaughter.
They played now about this house of Logie, but
with a difference. Up yonder the strife was ended
long since—the forlorn hopes that had tilted against
merchantry, and bribes, and guile. They could only
grieve for what could never come again. But here
was a fight in the making. Hardcastle was resolute
for some quarrel close at hand; and she had learned
enough of the Lost Folk, as they went through their
evil country, to know what the strife must mean in
the coming days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you have the tale, pedlar?” said Rebecca.
“I’ve need to excuse tears shed in sight of any
stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, tell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a man of my own once—a straight lad to
his height, and good at the wooing. We’d had a
lover’s tiff, and me too proud to do aught but send
word by roundabouts that he might come and be
sorry for his lout’s ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca fought with her grief again, and conquered
it. The rooks cawed fitfully from overhead. A bat
fluttered up and down the moonlit courtyard, and
Wharfe River sang old ballads of the peaceful days
under her time-worn bridge. But there was no
peace, here at Logie—only the rasp of Rebecca’s
voice as she went on with her tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Instead of my man, there came news to the gate.
Two of the Lost Folk had met him by the way,
and asked tribute. He said he was Hardcastle’s
man, and wouldn’t budge. And they killed him
for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good sort of death,” said Hardcastle, and
Causleen saw grey fear creep round him while he
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The russet gloaming, the quietness of wood and
pastures, the silent front of Logie, grey with travail
of the years—all made for the realities that live
beneath the turmoil of each day’s duties. Rebecca
seldom showed any of her heart. She bared it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You chose to loosen your pack, pedlar,” she said,
in harsh, even tones, “and you loosed the bygone
years as well. Every night and all I go to the gate,
and keep tryst with my man that never came. I’d
have kissed him free and full—would have worn
my hands to the knuckle for him through our wedded
days—but he couldn’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman in Causleen answered the break in
Rebecca’s voice. “How long ago was this?” she
asked, with soft, Highland pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve forgotten. Forty years, maybe, but I’ve
lost count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca still wore the mob-cap and the apron,
and the moonlight softened the harsh lines of face
and body. It was only when she spoke again, after
long silence, that she seemed old indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lost Folk killed him, and every night I get
to the gate and say my prayers. For every kiss he
might have had, I pray a blight on them. For every
child that might have run about my knees I ask that
two of their heathen brats may die in trouble. They
robbed me; and before I die, God send word to the
Wilderness Men that curses stick and sting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what I’ve seen of the Wilderness Folk,”
said Donald, “they’ll be dour enemies, stubborn and
crafty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s no news,” snapped Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stubborn and dour they’ll be—and I wish I’d a
younger pair of arms to help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hard, keen light showed in Rebecca’s eyes. Her
thin body quivered with sudden passion. “There
will come a token on the gate, Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle held out his palm, as Donald had done
awhile since, and Rebecca gloated on the sight of the
little, brown thing that meant the end of peace for
all at Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through the years I’ve wanted this. What will
you do with it, Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle turned, with a hard laugh, and set the
arrow-head on the drip-stone over his door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It stays here—a charm against all alms-giving
on Logie roads.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap03'>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<h3>THE END OF A JOURNEY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>When Hardcastle had opened the door to
Causleen and her father, and had thrown his
gun and brace of partridge down on the
long-settle in the hall, his hardness left him. These
two were guests, whatever chance had driven them
to the bleak roads where pedlars chaffered for a
livelihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brought them into a great, cosy room, aglow
with its fire of pine-logs and fragrant with the
smouldering peats that burned below. Causleen
glanced about, with a woman’s quickness to see all—the
candles in their sconces, bringing mellow lights
to birth on bees’-waxed panels—the orderly array of
muskets, swords and pistols on the walls—and,
over these, a pike with the red-rust on it of blood
shed long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald saw the pike only. “That was rieved
from Scotland once,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It went north to Flodden, and returned to
its own homestead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fire kindled in the pedlar’s syes. “Scots’ blood
on it?” he challenged, the years slipping from him
like a garment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scots’ blood—but it’s been drying for the length
of ten generations. Flodden was a fair fight, as
my folk passed the tale down—a fight between the
North-born folk. The Southrons came by land and
sea; but it was the Logie Men that ran in at the
edge of dusk, and settled that good battle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jaimie the King was slain that day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, he died well. There’s none in Logie Dale
but knows that he died well. We have the tale from
our fathers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedlar rose, though every bone in his body
was aching for rest long-denied. “Come, Causleen,”
he said. “We’ve no traffic with folk who slew the
king at Flodden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing whimsical to Hardcastle in this
passion that had survived the centuries. One of his
own tenants—a hale farmer-man of seventy—climbed
to the moor-top every morning of his life, to learn
if the Scots came marching south, though raids of
that sort were no more by this time than food for
winter gossip by the hearth. Quarrels lived to a
great age here in Yorkshire, as on the far side of
the Border; for their roots bit deep into strong,
ancient soils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is amiss with you, pedlar?” he asked,
looking down on these wayfarers who had come to
his gate—by chance, it seemed. In their faces he
read tenacity, strength to endure, something valiant
and at war with exile. “It was a fair and a bonnie
fight, I tell you, and I’d have been proud to have
been on either side that day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That may be,” said Donald restively; “but it’s
no house for us to lodge in. Your welcome was cold
at best—we’ll have none of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gathered dignity into his aching body, and
had neared the door when a clatter of wooden pattens
sounded down the passage, and Rebecca swept into
the room like a gale from the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come talk to Geordie Wiseman, Master,” she broke
in, without leave asked or granted. “He’s in the
kitchen, roaring for strong ale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No great news, that. Geordie was born with that
sort of roar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, but I’d have you come. He says the Lost
People have left an arrow on his gate, same as they’ve
done on yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Causleen saw little, grey wrinkles creep about
Hardcastle’s battered face, saw him recover with
stubborn strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come,” he said, after a moment’s silence,
“if only to tell him it’s nothing to make a cry about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he reached the kitchen, a tough, thick-set
farmer was standing by the hearth, his hair drabbled
with the sweat of abject dread, his knees shaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve put the token on us, Wiseman,” said
the Master. “It had to come, and better soon than
late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What need had it to come? Three of the Wilderness
Men asked tribute. Well, we’ve payed it for
many a year, and the roads have been easy for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Hardcastle never payed it—and a Hardcastle
never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can do what you like with your own skin;
but I tell you, plain man to man, you’d no right
to bring all your tenants into this. Better have
given those three all you had in your pockets than
us be murdered in our beds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As well have given them my soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your soul?” sneered Wiseman, chill with fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that. If I’d bartered it to the Lost Folk,
there’d have been the end of pride for me. And the
end of pride is hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it’s hell either way, it seems; for you’ve
brought it close to one and all of those who farm
under you. You didn’t stop to think of that when
they asked tribute?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think at all, Wiseman. I just saw the
three lousy rogues, straddling the road in front of
me, and I hit them, true and hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had your frolic—and soon they’ll be having
theirs. You’ve no wife to think of, Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Hardcastle, recalling sharply the might-have-been
that had ended long since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a wife and children myself, like many another
they’ll have lain the token on. If your time at the
pinfold came again, you’d remember it meant war
about Logie-side?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would,” said Hardcastle, as if a clean, lusty
wind blew through him, driving out all dread—“and
hit the three men true and hard again. Now,
listen to me. I’ve brought you all into this trouble,
and I’ll see you through it. Take my word as bond
for that. You’re needing ale, Rebecca tells me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A flood of it, just to get my balance straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can have it by and by. Ale is food for men,
but poison to this cry-baby fit that’s taken you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geordie Wiseman shifted from foot to foot, and
glowered at the Master. “We’re not all made of
boulder-stone and whipcord. It would come easy
to you to face the devil and his witch-hounds—but
I’m a usual man, like most of my neighbours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve put the token on us, Geordie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, yammer at it. To be sure they have, and
you fancy it a merry-making.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to me. There’ll be merry-making by
and by; but we’ve to mow a long swathe before then.
I’m sick and weary of the Wilderness Folk—sick of
the toll they’re levying on white-blooded men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My blood’s red enough, Hardcastle of Logie. If
you doubt it—why, here’s my coat off, and off goes
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the spirit,” laughed Hardcastle. “You’re
readier for what I have to tell you than you were
awhile since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” mocked Rebecca from the doorway—“readier
than he was just now, when he rived the
door of my kitchen wide, and stepped in with a face
made of tallow. ‘We’ll all be murdered in our beds,’
says he. ‘Not me for one,’ says I. ‘I’ll be murdered
standing, if at all—giving as good as I get while it
lasts.’ That’s what I said to Geordie—and now he’s
prancing up and down like a turkey-cock, with his
coat half-off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wiseman’s wrath against the Master found a new
channel. “As for you, Rebecca, it’s plain you know
less than a child what the token means, left on a
man’s gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know as much as my mother taught me, when
I was knee-high. There’s little I need to learn about
the Lost Folk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re blithe, are you, because the Master
fought with three, and left them to stir up their blessed
hornets’ nest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blithe, if you put it that way—though it’s a queer
kind of joy. It’s time these wastrels were hunted
out, like rats about a stable. They breed like rats, too,
and soon they’ll be eating us out of house and home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In league with the Master, as you always were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Geordie. He’s man enough to hunt the
Lost Folk from their burrows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now a queer thing happened. The Master
and Geordie crossed themselves by stealth, not knowing
why. The Lost Folk had been a running sore
about the country-side in far-off Catholic times, and
no man can deny his ancestors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Popish mummery,” snapped Rebecca, and
crossed herself as she spoke without knowing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a sudden, lusty knocking at the door,
and Brant the shepherd followed his knock, bringing
the strong, sweet tang of the uplands with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naught to be scared of, Geordie,” said Rebecca.
“You fancied three hundred Wilderness Men were
tramping in—or was it a thousand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant glanced at Wiseman with kindly tolerance.
“You wear a scared look on your face, Geordie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you heard what’s gathering round us
all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear little up yonder, thanks be, save crying of
the ewes, and stillness, and the wind. They’re better
gossips than your village-folk down hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca had an old fondness for the shepherd, and
the ale that Wiseman had clamoured for in vain was
brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s cold up yonder on the heights,” she said,
filling a wide mug for him. “Dark and lonesome,
too, after sundown, with ghosty Brown Men of the
Heather and what not flitting by you. But <span class='it'>you</span> were
never one to come with your knees a-wobble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning me?” said Geordie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning you, or any other man that thinks he’s
fitted with his proper cap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s it all about, Master?” asked Brant. “Is
Geordie just in his cups, with his tale of what’s gathering
round us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half in and half out. He’s himself most days of
the week,” said Hardcastle dryly. “There’s trouble
brewing, though, as he says. An arrow-head was left
on my gate last night, and on Geordie’s. It will come
to yours when they’ve time to get up to your cottage
on Gaunt Fell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it come,” said Brant, his face hard and bright
on the sudden. “I’ve wanted that for many a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would,” Rebecca nodded. “I’ve heard you
speak time and again in this same kitchen of their
sheep-stealing tricks. Theft of a sheep to you is
almost like what murder is to other folk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wry humour came to Hardcastle. “What luck
had you with Storm yesterday, after I left you up at
Weathersett? Did you find the four-legged thief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I,” growled Brant. “He’s just a slip of
devildom, ravening up and down the pastures. There
are times when I fancy he’s more than a sheep-dog
that’s tasted flesh instead of guarding it—times when
he seems to be Old Nick himself. Foxes at lambing-time?
They’re honest, set side by side with Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all that, I’m finding a soft spot in my heart
for the rogue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant took a long draught of ale, wiped the froth
from his mouth, and set down his pewter mug. “Are
you, Master? Then harden it. A sheep-slayer goes
cursed from the minute he gets from his lair at dawn
till daylight ends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you can’t take Storm. He’s hunted from the
four quarters of the sky, day in, day out, and wins
through. That’s the sort of dog I like—and the sort
of man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passion, with Brant, had the stillness of deep pools.
His voice lost little of its quietness; but a hard note
sounded in it. “It’s hard to tell what ewes mean to
a shepherd. They’re like children, you might say.
Happen it comes from mothering ’em from the day
they first stand up on their four wambly legs—newborn
and bleating at their dams. Happen it comes
of tending ’em later on—blizzards and drifts and what
all—comes of sleeping and waking for ’em. I couldn’t
tell all that goes to the hate of a sheep-killer. But
I know what every shepherd feels for every outlaw
dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just so,” said Hardcastle. “It’s for that reason
I’m all for Storm—the lad with never a friend in the
country-side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s easy for you to lose a sheep here and there.
What does it count if a few odd ewes are ravaged?
Just a few pounds missing from your plenty. For me,
it stands for murdered bairns—bairns I’ve reared and
guarded better than their scant-wit mothers could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are good sheep-tenders in the Dale, but
none quite like you. You do it all, Brant—the
damned, lonely fight against Logie weather, and foot-rot,
and marauders of all kinds—do it for love of silly
sheep that to me are so much fleece and mutton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re my life to me,” said the shepherd, “and
I’m still wondering why you side with Storm. Best of
his kind, he was once—knew how to round them up the
pastures like a marvel. Then he fell from grace, as you
might say, and he’s a hunted dog from this to
Weathersett.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and you and all of mine will know soon what
that sort of hunting means. I’ve a fellow-feeling for
old Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle turned his head sharply. He was still
standing just inside the kitchen door, and behind him
was the long passage that led into the hall. At the far
end of the passage was a place under the stairway, half
room, half cupboard, where logs and peats had been
stored in earlier times. It held a fugitive now—a
fugitive who was beating against the worm-eaten door
in search of freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s queer noises in the house,” stuttered
Geordie Wiseman. “I told you what would come of
saying no to the Lost Folk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shepherd had taken a second draught of ale.
That, and the cosy warmth, ripened the dry humour
that was never far to seek. “Queer noises in your
head, more like. If I’d slaked thirst as you’ve done
Geordie—all day long, and every day—I would be
hearing smith-hammers—but they’d be ringing in my
own headpiece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the passage came a running whine, that only
Hardcastle and Wiseman heard. The Master stood
silent, but Geordie began to bubble like a child lost in
the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now Barguest’s come. D’ye hear him whining?
I warned you what would come of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, be quit of your moonshine,” growled Brant.
“Such as you breed fears like maggots. What we’re
up against is enough for sober folk, without your
doldrum fancies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was well for Logie and all its tenantry that Storm,
as he came down the passage, heard Brant’s voice,
and checked his joy in liberty. Hardcastle felt a
rough pressure at his knee, and, looking down, saw the
sheep-thief’s grizzled snout pushed out an inch or two
into the lamplight. His hand went down, to cover
even that from the shepherd’s keen, revengeful eyes.
Storm’s nose was hot and dry, his body quivering;
for he always pictured Brant these days as carrying a
gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle backed into the doorway, keeping the
dog behind him. “Whatever comes, Brant, the Logie
Men will fight the Wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have to, thanks be,” said the shepherd
fervently. “You’ve made that sure and safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has,” whined Geordie Wiseman, “without
asking leave of Logie Men. Let him be murdered,
says I, if he fancies that sort of pastime—but what have
I done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naught that I can rightly call to mind,” said the
shepherd pensively. “There’s a tale that you were
caught working once, between one barley-brew and
the next—but you must have been younger then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle was glad of Rebecca’s cackle of laughter,
of Brant’s absorption in his jest. He nodded a good-night,
closed the kitchen door, and dragged Storm by
his collar down the passage. The cupboard under the
stair showed open to the lamplight. The door, with its
broken lock, creaked fitfully as the draught swung it to
and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fool, to leave safe quarters,” said the Master
savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm feared his wrath, but not as he feared Brant’s.
He was with a friend, and knew it. Quietly, without
fuss or protest, he got into his lair, turned three times
according to ancient ritual of his breed, and settled into
wary sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm,” said the Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two brown, faithful eyes opened, asking what was
needed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no holiday to shelter a broken dog. I’m quit
of you if you stir or whine till Brant has gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm understood. Bred in close intercourse with
men, he had their speech. The brown eyes met
Hardcastle’s, loyal in answer, and the Master closed
the door on him, knowing there was no need of the
broken lock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time, since going to answer for his own
part in the coming warfare, he remembered Pedlar
Donald and his girl. The candles were burnt half
down as he went into the big room, but the fire glowed
warm and ruddy on the pike that once had gone to
Flodden. There was an odd silence in the room, and
Causleen knelt by the long-settle, where Donald
stretched like a man dead and out of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen rose and faced him. Proud, even in bitter
grief. “We are not welcome here,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave you shelter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, grudgingly. We do not care for that—but
now we have no choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle crossed to the long-settle and stood
looking down on Donald; and Causleen’s eyes softened
a little as she met his glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The end of the journey?” he asked, with rough
sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear it. His heart beats, but it is fluttering out.
Just after you went his strength left him, and he
stumbled to the settle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two owls were hunting mice in Logie Wood. Their
cries sounded loud and ghostly through the silence. A
restless breeze was plucking at the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let the tears come,” said Hardcastle impatiently,
“You’ve need of ease.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap04'>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<h3>THE MORROW</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had got to bed somewhere near
midnight. There had been a farm-lad riding
for the doctor, the galloping return of both,
the verdict that Donald, with care, might live for a
week or two. Old Rebecca had scolded life and
destiny, but had managed with great deftness to make
the pedlar warm and easy on the long-settle, with
blankets under and over him. She had insisted, too,
on sharing the watch with Causleen, after telling the
Master there was nothing for a feckless mule to do by
way of help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ordered early breakfast. Best take a wink
or two o’ sleep while you’ve got the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Hardcastle was seeking sleep, and finding
little. When he dozed, it was to go in dreams through
things suffered at the Lost Folks’ hands long since,
told and re-told till superstition had given them a
bigger terror than their due. When he woke, it was to
remember that he and his stood alone against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He counted his household in the waking hours.
Indoors was Rebecca, and Roy, the old retriever—and
out across his acres tenants who numbered a score,
all told. Some of these had five sons, some three or
less, and not all of them up-grown. And among them
were a few of Geordie Wiseman’s kidney, whiners and
pay-for-safety folk at any price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then his mind roamed out to the crumpled, limestone
wastes that stretched from Drumly Ghyll to
grey Weathersett—the land where the Lost Folk had
their dwelling, in a village bare to every wind of devilry
that blew. They were stealthy, pitiless, spawn of the
creeping things that hunt by night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would doze again, and nightmares led him into
the caves he had explored in boyhood, because forbidden
by the father who knew their peril. Once he
had all but been caught there by a Wilderness Man,
and had returned with a glow of adventure in his
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he woke to restless tossing from one side to
another, adventure loomed close ahead; but it had
no glow about it. He recalled Geordie Wiseman’s
complaint that he brought trouble to many a hearth
beside his own. It was true, and doubt took hold of
him. What right had he to bring others into an affair
so stark and hard to face?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up at last, weary of the phantoms that creep
about a sleepless bed. Below-stairs he could hear
Rebecca scolding and coaxing a lazy fire to burn; and
when he came down a half-hour later, he heard still
the murmur of coaxing and scolding, though she was
at war with rashers crinkling on the fire. It was a
heartening note—this chiding tongue of Rebecca’s,
the grey, hard woman who kept his house spotless-clean,
and cooked and laboured for him as if she loved the
work. She was rough and loyal, reared in the older
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he passed the room where Donald lay, he heard
the pedlar chattering quietly, and went through the
half-open door. Causleen’s dark head was pillowed
on the horse-blanket covering Donald. The sleep of
dire exhaustion had found her as she knelt by the settle,
and even Hardcastle, roughened long since against any
lure of women, was moved to grudging pity. She was
so slender, so helpless, and her loosened hair lay round
her like a cloud of burnished night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he glanced again at Donald. The pedlar’s
eyes were open, and he talked of glens—talked of
Glencoe, and Bannockburn and far Culloden, of misty
sorrows that for ever drenched the hills he loved.
Again Hardcastle was stirred—not by pity now, but by
shame. If this ancient man, his body crumpling into
death, could live so bravely with the long-done battles,
counting these heartsease and gain, what had the
younger sort to do with fear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald did not see him standing there, for his eyes
were intent on wider scenes than this cramped room
afforded him. To Hardcastle, as he listened, a wider
country opened, too. The pedlar’s body had forsaken
him so utterly that heart and mind were free to roam
at large. The very throb of Scottish battle-strength
seemed gathered into this room at Logie—the skirl of
pipes, the sobbing of women as their dead were brought
home on their shields—the harsh challenge of men
facing treachery in many hidden glens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Hardcastle that the pedlar was sharing
five centuries of battle. So he was, maybe, for a man’s
dead come close when he nears the borderland, to
welcome him across the little gap between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald lingered awhile with the feud fights of the
clans, with the big battles and the small; but ever he
returned to the tale of how Jaimie the King went down
in splendour when the last, swirling fight at Flodden
closed about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the pedlar’s restless glance fell on the pike
nailed above the mantel, and stayed there awhile, and
roamed to the big man looking down at him. For the
first time he saw Hardcastle, and came sharply from
the glens of mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Small wonder I dreamed of Flodden and the king.
There’s a pike yonder with Scots’ blood on it. What
could there be but haunted sleep in such a room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strove to rise, but all of him from waist to feet
refused his bidding. It was terrible, piteous, to see the
struggle of a proud man anxious to be gone from a
house at enmity with his so long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank you for the lodging,” he murmured,
courteous to the last; “but we must go. Causleen,
child, where are you? The mists are gathering over
Ben Crummart, and winds are sobbing in the glens. We
must be going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the sleep of exhaustion Causleen heard the
call. She was on her feet in a moment, laying
the pedlar’s head back and soothing him to quiet.
The quickness of it, the eagerness that gave all and at
once to this wayworn vagabond, brought a rough
wonder to Hardcastle. But then she was a woman,
and no doubt there was trickery of some kind under
this show of great affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He longed to go, but could not. If Donald were
to die now and here, he must not leave one slim girl to
face the trouble, full of guile though she might be. He
watched her put a hand on the old man’s heart, and
wrap the blankets round him; and still he could not go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she turned and saw him there, shame and
pride took fire together. She glanced at the hair
which ran loosened to her knees, and hated him for the
surprise. She glanced, too, as Donald had done, at
the pike above the mantel; her voice was cold and hard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall not trouble you for long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great anger flamed in Hardcastle. “Am I such a
churl as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were a churl last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I know he was an ailing man?
There’d have been no doubt of your welcome then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our country all benighted guests are welcome;
but you’re a harsher folk in Yorkshire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced again at Donald. “Shall I send Rebecca
to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master turned without a word. She chose to be
at war with him, and he was content enough; better
that than the pity she had roused. When a man began
to pity any woman, he had one foot already in the
marshes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had reached the door, and was closing it behind
him, when she recalled him. “You, too, were ill last
night. Have you recovered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m in rude health, now as then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear is a sickness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glowered down at her, and Causleen
learned in that moment what the strength of his blow
would have meant if she had carried a man’s shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be. I never had much traffic with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until yesterday. We brought the token, and I
watched grey fear come to the Master of Logie as he
touched it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her rancour was less for herself than for the slight
put on Donald, sick and old, who in his prime had
known the glow of candlelight on a well-ordered table,
the ruby in the wine of life. And now her father lay
there, a pensioner on the bounty of this dour host—lay
dying, with the Flodden pike sneering at him overhead,
and all the room packed with ghosts of men who had
boasted through the generations of what they had done
aforetime to the Scots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Highland men have never known fear?”
asked Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faced him, slender and straight, her dark hair
like a glory about her tattered pedlar’s clothes. “Only
its name,” she said, with the same quiet mockery—“and
that they had from the Southrons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then God help them for no more than beasts of
the field. What courage could they learn, unless they
came to grips with fear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen remembered many journeys, with fortune
at its worst and only the pedlar’s voice to rouse her
from the depths. “Fear is a good whetstone, child,”
he would say. “It breaks poor metal, but sharpens
steel.” And now Hardcastle was giving her the same
rough gospel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you learn so much?” she asked, half-defiant
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last night—no longer since than that—while I
thought of all the uproar I’d brought to Logie-side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced once more at Donald, then turned and
went down the passage. Rebecca was bustling into
the sunlit breakfast-room with a tray that held many
tempting odours for a hungry man. She fussed
pleasantly about the Master’s needs, as of old, but with
a new solicitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm-cocks were crying round Logie all the
night,” she said, breaking the silence at last—“or else
I dreamed they were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dreamed it, likely. This weather’s not for
breaking yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe not—but the Lost Folks’ weather is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It had to break,” said Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the silence fell between them—the silence
that was more ultimate than speech. None knew
better than these two the staunchness that would be
asked for by and by, when the Wilderness loosed its
spite against them, and only a few were left to stand
against the pestilence that would sweep over Logie-side—the
pestilence of dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald is sinking fast, by the look of him,” said the
Master presently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll not quit the house till he dies. Not a doubt
o’ that; but he may sink very gradual. I’ve seen such
cases.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was as well I didn’t turn him away last night.
He’d not have got far, poor devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As well maybe,” grumbled Rebecca, “though I’ve
no stomach for tending him and the dark-eyed hussie
for weeks on end. We’ve lived to ourselves till now,
and I never relished foreigners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re under my roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’ll be looked after, Master. And, to be
sure, it’s as ill to slight the pedlar-sort as it is to kill a
spider. Lucky they are, both o’ the tribes, if you
treat ’em kindly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky?” said Hardcastle, getting up from table.
“Donald found the token for me, if that spells luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does. We’ll be rid of the Wilderness scum at
last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last—and may it be a long last,” snapped the
Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had forgotten Storm the sheep-slayer—as he was
forgetting many things in this new day of strife—until
he passed the cupboard where he had housed the
culprit over-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm was not there. He had watched for this
moment, after the house-doors were opened, and had
gone away to the hills by stealth. Hardcastle laughed
soberly. One guest the less under his roof was one load
taken from his shoulders; and the pack promised to
be heavy by and by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His own dog, Roy, was waiting for him in the hall—a
big retriever, his coat sleek and gold-red as October
on the brackens. His nut-brown eyes danced as he
saw the gun under Hardcastle’s arm, and clouded when
the Master checked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As far as the gate, lad. There’s only you to guard
Logie, and the Wilderness Folk are out at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sharp regret came to Hardcastle as he shut the gate
on Roy, a sense almost of foreboding. It did not seem
good to be separate at such a time, from a friend of ten
years’ standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard,” he said. “The Lost Folk are out, I tell
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roy whimpered as he reared across the closed gate
and licked Hardcastle’s face. He was getting near to
old age, as dogs count life; but the lure of a gun renewed
his youth at all times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle turned as he went down Logie-lane.
The dog had his forepaws on the gate still, and he
barked a friendly, dolorous farewell. “Guard, lad,”
said the Master, “the Lost Folk are out, I tell
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His errand lay over Logie Brigg, and up into the
wooded roadway that climbed steeply to Langerton.
Beyond Langerton were the Wilderness Folk, who
were out against him to a man—lurking close at
hand, maybe, in twos or threes. Hardcastle paid
no heed. He had gone through the sweat of fear last
night, and to-day sunrise was with him after that long
battle. Dread, rooted generations deep, had been
fought and thrown in the space of a night, he fancied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the bend of the road where it strode, over Crooning
Water, a quiet, slender woman sat on the copestone
of the bridge. She had a pile of picked willow-stems
at her right hand, and was busy with a half-made
basket lying in her lap. In all the Dale there was no
more sequestered nook than this, none richer with the
peace and mellowed glory of October. Crooning
Water, escaped not long since from the prison-house
of Drumly Ghyll—its rocks steep and dark and terrible—raced
down with a bubbling song of liberty, and
halted to play round the whirlpool delved by waters
that had gone before and were one by now with the
distant seas. A place of sanctuary, like an old kirk
ready with its welcome for young, honest love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman on the bridge glanced up at Hardcastle’s
approach, and into her eyes there leaped God knows
what of devilry, appeal, regret. And he, for his part,
stood looking at her with a wonder that for a moment
was a boy’s wonder, till he shut the gates on what
had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still basket-weaving, Nita?” he asked gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And still weaving spells about the men of Logie-side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was provocative, inscrutable, as of old, this girl-woman
whose grey eyes and flower-like face were all in
keeping with the russet autumn peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About all but one,” said Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that one’s here with me. He’s here with me
where we met first. Do you remember?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle remembered, in savage earnest. She
had not changed in these five years, so far as slender
beauty went, and the nameless charm that drew men
to her—drew all men except one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a dreamer then—and younger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s good to dream at times. I weave a good deal
of dream-stuff into my baskets as I make them—and
wonder what happens when a simple lass up-dale sets
her arm under the handle. Queer thoughts will come
to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will,” said the Master, rough and stubborn—“but
the thoughts will be good for your trade. <span class='it'>Never
put all your eggs into one basket, for fear the withies
break.</span> So they’ll buy two, when next you come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never forgive?” said Nita Langrish, her
voice soft as Crooning Water’s where it lapped the
archway of the bridge below them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done better, Nita—I’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced up to learn if it was true. He
stood there unyielding, utterly remote; and a great
longing came to Nita to chain and hold this man who
had put her out of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wanted me for your wife once. Is it too late,
Hardcastle of Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at her in frank astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are last year’s nests too late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a fool. Perhaps five years have taught me
to be wise. And you’re harsh these days. Is it love
of me that’s hardening you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, God be thanked. It’s love of hardness for its
own sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let him go the length of the bridge and a little
beyond, then called him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re hardy, to come so near the Wilderness Folk,
after what we’ve left on your gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his boast not long ago, Hardcastle
remembered how he had once cared for this bonnie
slip of devildom, the sleepless nights he had gone
through in that far-off time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put what you will on my gate,” he said, “except
those slim hands of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it not enough to meet three of our men,” she
asked, with dangerous quiet, “and send them bleeding
home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was good while it lasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you want me, too, for enemy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re of the Wilderness these days, Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was I, a moment since? You would laugh if I
told you what I was weaving into my baskets, before
you came and spoiled it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle’s face was grim as the nether-millstone.
“I’m past your sort of guile, Nita. No woman takes
me twice in the same net.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But was it guile? Suppose, as I threaded the withies
in and out, I was thinking of Logie—and its Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of twenty other men, no doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had struck home at last. She got to her feet,
shaken by a storm of passion. “Fancies are no crime.
I’d have lost every man in the dale for sake of Hardcastle
of Logie—aye, and have burned their houses at
a word from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle felt a touch of her old, bewildering power,
but recovered sharply. “You had me at call once,
and tore that dream to tatters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were too much at call. I’m of the sort that
wearies unless a man’s escaping me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re frank,” said Hardcastle, shrugging his
wide shoulders. “It seems a long way off, Nita—the
time when you would come and make a day hell or
heaven for me. You chose your road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now she had lost him; she recalled with bitter clearness
the way of her playing with him long since,
because he was so big and yet so downright drowned in
love. All the might-have-been turned to venom,
though she had caged her temper and was smiling in
quiet mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said—“as you chose your road yesterday.
The Wilderness Men you taunted me with just
now—I keep them at bay by promising favours to one
and another, and by giving none. When danger gets
too close, I set them at each other’s throats—for your
sake, until now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my sake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men know so little.” Her glance met his in search
of weakness or relenting, and found none. “So now
I shall set them all at <span class='it'>your</span> throat, Hardcastle of Logie,
and they’ll bring blithe hearts to the game. You know
what follows the token left on a gate? There comes
a shaft out of nowhere, aimed at Logie. Then a spell
of quiet, and after that another shaft. You’ve heard
the way of the Lost Folk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” said the Master, his head lifted sharply.
“And now the Lost Folk are to learn the way of Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita warmed to the change in this man who had been
easy going once, a slave to her whims. And with the
warmth came a new bitterness that she had lost one
who could show this spirit, walking alone as he did so
near the Wilderness that soon would be eating into his
courage like a cancer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve a gun under your arm,” she said. “That’s
for fear, I take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It’s for a chance shot at partridge on the
way to Michael Draycott’s. He fancies he’s a day or
two from death, and wants his will made out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Men do fancy that, if they’ve the toothache or
their little finger smarts. And of course you’re a
magistrate these days.” The grey eyes enticed and
mocked him. “I had forgotten. I was back, somehow,
in the times when we roamed Logie Woods
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re gone,” said the Master—“dead and
mouldered out of sight by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a man at all, or just an oak-tree going on
two feet about Logie-side?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man?” echoed Hardcastle, with a quiet laugh.
“That’s in the proving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that he went up the road, and turned in at the
gate that opened on Michael Draycott’s pastures.
Nita thought he would glance back once at least,
drawn by old allegiance. She would have forgiven
him much for the glance; but he went up the slope
and out of sight, cocking the hammers of his gun. He
was thinking already of partridge, not of the random
days behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seated herself again on the parapet and took up
her basket-work; and none could have guessed, seeing
her tranquil beauty, what thoughts she was weaving
now into the plaited withies. Crooning Water lapped
and gurgled. A curlew was plaining across the fells,
and from some wayside tree a starling was mimicking
his note. No other sound broke the fragrant peace
till the scrunch of feet sounded down the highway and
a stocky, undersized man swung round the bend. He
stopped on seeing Nita and touched his cap with rough
deference. Bonnie, a temptress who flouted and
smiled on them by turns, Nita had a strange hold on the
regard of the Wilderness Men, though few of their
women were of like mind. The men held her in honour,
too; and this was due, maybe, to the knowledge that
more than once she had set them an example of cold-blooded
savagery that none could equal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met him of Logie up Draycott’s pasture,” said
the man, a still look in his beady eyes. “Walked as
if he owned all from this to hell hereafter. ‘Got a gun
with you. You’re wise,’ says I; ‘but why do you go
sporting without a dog?’ and Hardcastle laughs.
‘The dog’s guarding Logie from such as you.’ ‘Then
you’re wise again,’ says I, ‘for Logie will ask for a lot
of guarding by and by.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he a fool altogether?” asked Nita, glancing up
from her basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t say that—not by a long way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like it. He’s chosen to rouse the Wilderness
round him, like a hive of bees. There can only
be one end to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true enough; but the ending mayn’t be this
year or next. Fight sinks the fool in Hardcastle.
That’s what our three Broken Men said when they came
from the pinfold yesterday, and all the women laughing
at them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid of him already, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not myself. A darkish night, and me with
just enough light to see where to crack his skull—and
Hardcastle riding the lonely roads he’s fond
of——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in good time.” Nita’s voice was clear as a
throstle’s, her fingers busy with the willows. “Before
an end comes to him that way, Jake, we’ll strike
elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you choose. You’re wiser than the rest of us
put together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll maim before we kill. Hardcastle is a fool
altogether, I tell you so. He cares for his own, when
wise folk care for themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s few enough he cares for these days, I
should have said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he cares deeper for the few. There’s one close
friend the Master has—and this is what you’ll do,
Jake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she told her mind to him; and he gaped in
admiring wonder for a while, till she bade him get about
his business of the day. And after that, in the hollow’s
tranquil silence, she threaded her withies in and out as
she sat on the bridge—the bridge where Hardcastle
had seen her first.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap05'>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<h3>HEMLOCK</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle found no partridge in the long
pasture that led to Draycott’s farm; but a
hare got up under his feet as he neared the gate.
Most shots came easily to Hardcastle, but from boyhood’s
days a hare had roused always the same surprise,
with its lopping stride that seemed slow and
bulky, disguising a strong wind’s speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He missed now with the first barrel—at simple
range—and puss got into a scrub of hazels that climbed
the hillside. When she ran through it, brown against
the grey rocks above, she was out of range to all but
the most sanguine fancy. Hardcastle gave her the left
barrel at a venture, and his heart warmed as he saw her
sprawl every way at once and lie still against the rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he went to pick her up and found her shot
cleanly through the head, he took it for a good omen.
Long hazards seemed to be his luck, and he needed many
kinds of luck these days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Michael Draycott was sitting up in the great
four-poster bed when Hardcastle went in. The man’s
apple-red face was paler than its wont, but his eyes
were keen and shrewd as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll know more than you before so very long,”
was Draycott’s greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know more already, Michael—the ways of
sheep, and land tending, and things I learned from
you as a lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and I could still teach you summat about
horses and dogs, though you’ll differ as to that. But
I wasn’t thinking of such matters. Before long I’ll
take a journey no man knows t’other side of—and in
a twinkling I’ll be wiser than all Logie-side. I’m not
afraid, you’ll know—I’m just in a fret to be gone, and
know what lies beyond, and be master of you all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not be master yet, for you’re not within
sight of dying, Michael.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were always very free with your opinions.
Why shouldn’t I die, with all my bones a-tremble,
and a wambling back and front of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because your father lived to ninety, and you’re
a lad of sixty-five. He’d think shame of you to creep
over the Border at your time of day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s sense in that,” Michael agreed, with a hard,
wheezy laugh. “Come to think of it, there’s a good
deal of sense. I never thought of it in that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve left a hare in your porch, against the time
you’re needing a sturdy meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ll have to hang for a week or more before it’s
ripe, but thank you all the same,” said Michael,
wistfully. “I own that the thought of it gets me back
to this side o’ things again. You jug a hare, if it’s
to be treated right, and run a pint of staunch port
wine into the stour of it, and thank the God who made
you for the dish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you needn’t make your will just yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but I must, though I’m feeling stronger every
minute since you came. It’s this way, Master. I
never wedded, as you know—thanks be for the escapement.
All the kin I have is a nephew that’s gone oversea,
and a niece that’s pretending to be a lady in London
town. If I knew which I hated most, I’d will all I
have to t’ other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then leave it over, Michael, till you’ve got your
strength back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I might. But I’ve one thing to say to
you, Hardcastle of Logie. They put a token on my
gate last night, because I was tenant to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That carries to us all,” said the Master, hard and
wary on the sudden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you thought what it means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I’m cold when I think of it—for myself,
but more for you of Logie-side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now listen. I built this snug fortune o’ mine
from naught at all, as you might say, and thrived on
sheep and cattle, thinking of little else. But I wouldn’t
have built it unless I’d payed tribute to the Lost
Folk, same as my father did before me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own father never had that failing,” said
Hardcastle, stating a fact and proud of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Wilderness was not so strong then. Staunch
as he was, he’d have sung to another tune these days.
They out-number us, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d have sung to the same tune—but with a
lustier voice because the odds were bigger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apple-red was glowing again in Draycott’s
cheeks. His fancied ailments were forgotten. “So
you take no shame to spread fire and murder through
the country-side?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take pride for holding my own ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, stubborn, like all you Hardcastles; but lord
help me to guess where pride comes in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you pay in tribute now? Twice what it
was in my father’s time—and so on till you’d have
been beggared, you tax-paying folk. That’s where
pride comes in, Michael. I’m glad to have set war
between this and the Wilderness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael Draycott was prone to coddle his fancied
illnesses, but under the foible lay a heart quick to
answer real trouble when it came. He got out of bed
with a speed astonishing in a sick man no longer young,
and stood there in his nightshirt, fronting Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll not be many with you among the lazy men
of Logie—but there’ll be me for one. While I get my
breeches on, will you pass word to the kitchen that
I’m roaring for a meal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time since they set a token on his gate,
the Master laughed, from his heart upward. Michael
had salted the coming days with humour, and it went
with him as he halted at the kitchen door, and saw
inside a red-haired lass who was baking an apple-pie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The master is crying out for breakfast, Susan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned a scared face to him. “He was dying
awhile since,” she stammered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was; but now he’s alive again, like the rest
of us. You’ll get used to these recoveries when
you’ve been longer in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that he was gone; and humour stayed with
him as he went down the pasture and out into the
highroad. Nita was finishing her basket when he
reached the bridge that girdled Crooning Water, and
she glanced at him with innocent, grey eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going home to Logie?” she asked.
“You’ll have news of a friend there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again old bitterness soured laughter and all else
in Hardcastle. “The Wilderness teaches most trades,
Nita. You’re for telling the future nowadays—silver
in your parlour, and promise of a dark lady coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m for telling the present. The friend is no
lady, dark or fair—and he’s waiting for you at the
gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle forgot her, forgot even the sharp, slender
plough she had driven across his life, breaking it up.
He came to Logie Brigg, and feet of the marching men
sounded in his ears as he strode up the hill to Logie.
In their day fight was easy—march, and camp, and
straightforward ding of blows when battle came—but
this modern warfare thrust on him was a stealthy
matter, hard to wage. The old days were better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Hardcastle heard not only the tread of
feet, but song of the battle-men as they went to whatever
chanced. They did not pick their road, as he
was asking to choose it now, did not fall to dreaming
of warfare that had been. The ruts and the hardships
had been different then; but the call to conquer
them was the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle did not know himself in this mood.
His fore-elders were intent about him—brave, brawny
folk who compassed Logie, a regiment of fighting men.
And so in great heart he climbed the hill, and came
to his gate, and found a message scrawled in chalk.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hemlock grows in the Wilderness.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all, till he tried to open the gate, and felt
a weight against it. He put an impatient shoulder
to the topmost bar, and there inside lay Roy, a dead
thing with no joy of welcome. Froth of the death-throes
flecked his jaws and his gold-brown hide. He
had watched for the Master faithfully, and for reward
lay here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence came to Hardcastle, and a great sickness—sickness
of heart, that is the worst to bear. He could
not believe for awhile that this comrade had gone
before his time. He had reared him as a puppy—a ball
of golden fluff that played strange antics—had nursed
him through distemper and trained him to the gun.
As if he stood at the graveside of a familiar friend,
long thoughts went racing down the years. He recalled
the very smell of the heather when grouse swept
cluttering up the moor, the crisp, frosty silence as
they waited for the wild-duck to come over. They
had roused all Logie-land together, good weather and
foul, and had tramped home with happy weariness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trouble went deep. Roy had slept outside his
bedroom door, had been the first to welcome him
when he got up for the day’s business, the last to wag
his tail in token of good-night. And Roy had gone.
His body was here—but what of the eager spirit, the
loyalty that never faltered, the eyes that spoke because
the tongue was dumb? Many had failed Hardcastle
in his time, but never Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No longer since than yesterday, Roy had been with
him up the pastures, and now he was away to some
far land. What land? With the question came a
swift, wayward hope that he had found moors out
yonder, and birds rising to the gun, and wind among
the brackens—a faith that they would rejoin each
other later on, when his time came to die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could ease grief of this sort but remembrance
of the second token on his gate. Hemlock
grew in the Wilderness, and they had poisoned the
thing he loved best in the world—the friend that
Nita, weaving her basket where the Brigg crossed
Crooning Water, had told him would be waiting.
And now little, crimson lines began to dance before
his eyes, and widened swiftly till he saw nothing but
a sheet of fiery red, and behind it the styes where the
Lost Folk housed themselves. It was battle-sunrise,
drinking up the fears of generations; and many never
had known it, from Flodden’s day to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, spent with watching by the long-settle
where her father lay in deep sleep at last, had come
out for a breath of this clean, upland air. She would
go to the gate, and a little beyond, maybe—but not
far away from the sick man who might need her at
any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got no further than the gate. Her sympathy
was quick for dogs; and, seeing Roy there in all his
dead, silent disarray, she knelt beside him and hid a
sudden rush of tears in the coat that had been warm
yesterday, when he growled at her coming and afterwards
gave friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was so brave and bonnie—and he’s gone,”
she said, glancing up between wet lashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roy needs no praise,” growled Hardcastle,
roughened by his loss. “If you’d known him as I
did, you’d let your tongue be still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her pride took fire. From the first he had been
surly and resentful of her coming. Yet her feet
dragged, as she left him with his dead. She halted
and glanced back; and there was Hardcastle, his
shoulders bowed with sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you cared for him,” she said, her voice low
with pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cared? He was all left to care for, except Logie.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap06'>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<h3>THE EWE-GATHERING</h3>

<p class='pindent'>They were gathering their sheep from the fells
under Pengables, to bring them down into the
warmer lands below. To a stranger it would
have seemed odd that so many shepherds, and master-farmers
with their hinds, should have chosen the same
day. The farmers, indeed, might have done the work
at haphazard, choosing a time here and there as occasion
served; but their shepherds lived nearer the fell-tops
where true weather-lore was taught by countless little
signs and tokens. And the shepherds had decreed
that within eight-and-forty hours the wind hounds of
the north would be driving snow before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Logie country, if it guessed what was to come,
made merry with the time left it. Quiet wisps of cloud
lay bosomed on a sky of blue. The belt of woodland
under Pengables—larches, pines and rowans, their
feet set deep in the heather—glowed in the hot sun glare
with rich array of russet and amber, and wide-flung
crimson—the riot of it all subdued by the still majesty
of the pines, who kept their burnished livery secure
against all onset of the seasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the land was filled with uproar—dogs barking
their throats hoarse, sheep crying witless and forlorn,
men cursing ewes and dogs and neighbour-folk in rich
upland speech. When each shepherd had only his own
ewes to look after, and his own dog to work them, they
went silently about the business, save for a whistle or
a quiet call. But now the dogs were mad with rivalry.
The sudden busy-ness of these quiet fells was to them
what market day in Shepperton meant to the shepherds
when they went there once in a while and were amazed
by the town’s confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shepherd Brant, a great leader of dogs and ewes,
began at last to get order out of havoc, and all was going
well when Michael Draycott—he that was lying on his
death-bed a fortnight since, till Hardcastle persuaded
him to get out of it—came driving a flock of three-score
down the lane the bracken-sledges took. They came
plump into a company that Brant was shepherding
along the track to Logie, and a bleak-witted cry went
up to heaven from two hundred sheep that turned all
ways at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant took command in earnest now. “Durn you,
Michael, will you leave shepherding to shepherds.
What’s the use of you, quavering with a stick and
walking as if your toes were on hot bricks? A figure
of fun, I call you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll leave it to you gladly, Brant,” chuckled
Michael, the sweat dripping from his cheery face. “For
my part I’ve had enough and to spare of the game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then get a hand into the collar of that fool-dog of
yours, and see how mine has learned to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael obeyed. Brant and he were old enough in
friendship to make small account of plain speech
between them, and the farmer watched the other’s
dog at work with growing approbation—watched him
as he drove some of the ewes in front, thrust others
aside, getting his own and those that did not matter
into two companies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gift, I call it—a fair marvel,” he muttered,
talking to the dog he held by the collar. “See ’em at
it—Brant and his snod-haired collie. We’re a rough
couple, lad, when it comes to rounding sheep up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flocks were separate at last, and Brant’s dog
padded up and down with restless question what was
asked of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home to Logie,” said the shepherd, “I’ll follow
soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael grew wide-eyed with wonderment as he saw
the ewes go down the slope, the collie shepherding a
straggler now and then with quiet persuasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can do almost aught but talk, Brant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does it better for that lack,” said the shepherd,
filling his pipe. “Dogs have the pull of us there.
They work instead of talking. Lordie, it’s been a warm
job, this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks to you shepherds. What fool’s tale did
you come telling, about north wind and snow?” put
in Geordie Wiseman, sauntering to join them from a
neighbouring farm lane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bide a day or two, and you’ll learn. For myself,
I’m glad of a breathing-time, while Scamp yonder takes
’em home to Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t a pup of his fathering, Brant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have, as it happens, but I’d never trust him to
your lowland training,” growled Brant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shepherd fell into great moodiness, till Michael
rallied him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s gone amiss?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm’s gone amiss,” snapped Brant. “Scamp
does well enough—a good second of the twins I reared—but
Storm was known from this to Carlisle for what he
was—the best dog in the north for sheep. And now
he’s tasted flesh, and no cure for him but the barrels
of a gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rare dog,” assented Wiseman, “but too clever,
as you might say. He went past himself. You’ve not
chanced on him yet, I take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. I begin to fancy he’s savaging another
man’s flocks by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm, if they had known it, was watching them from
above, where he lay coiled in a clump of bracken under
Pengables. For a week and a day, since Hardcastle
first gave him house-room, he had roamed at large,
raiding and sleeping and skulking by turns; and, as he
came warily across the moor this morning, the uproar
from the fells below roused ancient memories. With
slow craftiness, his body crouched to take advantage
of such cover as rocks and heather gave him, he
had wormed his way to the foot of Pengables,
and now looked on, an outlaw, at the work speeding
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had shared that work in other years, had heard
men praise him, had seen his fellow-dogs give jealous
homage to his fame. And now he lay here, with the
blood of a late-slain ewe scarce dried on his rough
muzzle. None praised him to-day. He had lost
repute, and every hand was turned against him—even
Brant’s, his old master; and across Storm’s hard,
relentless eyes there stole a mist of grief. That weakness
passed. The wolf-lust in him blazed afresh,
kindled in the old-time of his ancestors. He remembered
last night’s slaughter—the mad joy of killing,
just for slaughter’s sake. He thought of the night to
come. Then he turned three times in his bracken lair,
and his head dropped on his forepaws. For he was full
fed and sleepy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the same moor that Storm had crossed, Hardcastle
of Logie came from business he had at Nether
Helstone. They liked to have him with them at the
ewe-gathering, and he was later than he had meant;
but for all that he halted when he reached the grim rockpile
of Pengables, set four-square like a fortress on the
hill-top. He, too, was looking down on a remembered
scene, as Storm had done, and with a sense of utter
loneliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched the wild gathering-scene below—the
sheep scampering every way at once, the dogs half-crazied,
the men who seemed, most of them, little surer
of their wits. Then he saw order come from the bedevilment,
till at last the whole of the wide fells below
him took moving shape. There was no longer a waste
of close-cropped pastures. It was hidden by long,
swaying flocks that glided to their lowland shelter-fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the grey sheep moved through the day’s heat,
the sweat of their fleeces rose to a sunlight that turned
it into rainbow mist; and Hardcastle stood looking
down on old, familiar country changed to fairyland.
The spell of it was on him. He had not known what
glamour lay about this simple Gathering Day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook himself free of dreams, and glanced across
the valley. Garsykes, the village of the Lost Folk, was
sending wood-smoke up into the quiet sky as if it were
a haunt of peace. Yet it had put a token on his gate,
had killed old Roy already, and would burn Logie next,
no doubt. It seemed destined that he should lose the
few things left him nowadays to care for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here on the heights he learned suddenly what Roy’s
loss meant to him. First grief, when he found the dead
body at his gate, had been tempered by the shock that
stuns. Through the days that followed he had shut
down the windows of his heart, lest he looked too closely
through them. There were other dogs in plenty to be
had. He must buy one to-morrow—or perhaps the
morrow after. So he told himself; but now, as again
he looked across at Garsykes, he hungered just for Roy.
If all was in the losing, because he had battered three
men of the Wilderness, he could have faced it better
if Roy had been beside him. He had no fear now.
But he had loneliness, that can bite like east wind into
the marrow of a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep-nibbled grass sloped sharply down on this
side of Pengables, and when he reached the hill-foot—half
running and half sliding, as fell-racers do—he was
checked by a sudden growl from the brackens on his
right. Storm’s sleep these days was light as the
triggers of pursuing guns. He was on his feet already,
his teeth bared behind the tell-tale ruddy lips. Then,
as he saw who the intruder was, he just stood and looked
at him, his air ludicrously changed. The brown eyes
grew full of deprecation, appeal, assurances that he was
a mishandled and misjudged fugitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle laughed quietly. “I believe no word of
it, but you’re safe from me. I give you my word for
that. There’s Brant down there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm followed his pointing finger, then glanced at
his face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Brant down there—and more fool you to
make an uproar when a friend comes by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now about these two there came sharp intuition,
such as thrives in times of peril. Storm had always
liked the smell of this man who had saved him twice—once,
when he gave him shelter at Logie, and now when
he might have betrayed him to Shepherd Brant below.
He thrust his rough head into the Master’s hand—the
head smeared by blood, and packed within by the
Wilderness knew what of guile and wolf-lust—and of
loyalty to his chosen man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then Hardcastle knew that in sober truth he had
bought another dog—but not with money. He bade
Storm keep close, and left him in his lair, and went
swinging down the fells. Loneliness had gone, though
in the peaceful days he would have sneered at any man
who told him he could take cheer of heart from an
outlaw such as Storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last swaying companies of sheep went out of
sight behind the shoulder of the track as he strode
down. From time to time a man’s voice sounded, or
a collie’s eager yelp, muffled by distance into softer
melody. For the rest there was the intimate and
friendly silence of a land ripe with autumn’s big content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That lasted till he neared the road where Shepherd
Brant was gossiping with Michael Draycott and filling
another pipe before he took the home-track to Logie.
Then the jar of men’s voices raised in quarrel killed all
peace, and Hardcastle, glancing down, saw five of the
Wilderness Folk confronting the two of Logie. He
made light of the quarter-mile between himself and
trouble, and Brant turned at sound of his coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve missed you,” he grumbled; “but better
late than never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, ask these lean swine from Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five were tongue-tied and loutish, till one of
them—Jake Bramber, who had talked with Nita on
the bridge and afterwards gone to Logie to feed old Roy
with meat and hemlock—strutted his squat impudence
up to Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a dog called Storm,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is,” Hardcastle agreed, with bitter quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s taken many sheep of ours. So I just asked
Brant if he’d missed any ewes of his own this morning
when he counted the tally. He owned to a score.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, you needn’t be so high and mighty about it.
They’re in our pinfold yonder—tribute, as you might
say, for what Storm’s done to ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a pinfold over Logie way, and three sheep
of yours tried to stop me there. Did I break all their
bones, or only half? I’ve often wondered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the five men stared at Hardcastle, marvelling
at his hardihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one of you killed a dog of mine,” said the
Master, his eyes holding Jake’s, “and he’ll pay toll for
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems as if times were changed,” growled the little
man, strutting it still. “D’ye know what it means
when the Lost Folk put an arrow on a gate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know,” said Hardcastle—“and, Brant, go
down to their pinfold and bring back our ewes.”</p>

<h3>THE BATTLE OF THE FLEECE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Michael Draycott rubbed his hands together
as he saw the five shrink back. They
were not used to such frank and instant
challenge. Hardcastle had reminded them, moreover,
of what he had done to certain men of theirs;
and they looked on with sullen wonder as Brant
brought up the twenty ewes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Jake Bramber who first spoke. “Leave us
those ewes, and maybe we’ll call it quits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quits?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s been a long peace between you Logie
Folk and ours. You wouldn’t break it for a matter
of a few sheep?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s talking sense, Master,” quavered Geordie
Wiseman. “Let him have ’em, and save us all from
being murdered every night of our lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A laugh went up; but Hardcastle was in no mood
for merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two roads, Geordie,” he said sharply—“to
Logie or the Wilderness. You’ve got to choose.
If a tenant of mine gives any sort of tribute—aye, if
it’s a penny to a brat of theirs—he crosses over to
Garsykes. And may hell deal softly with him there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The five men drew further back from Hardcastle.
More than his rugged strength, more than memory
of the battered three who had returned they feared
this man’s strength of spirit, revealed suddenly—feared
the ring of his voice, the upright head and
brawny shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hard man, you,” said Jake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a hard man, I, and God be thanked for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But an arrow-head left on a gate? It can weaken
the hardest—by degrees. A blow in the dark say,
or a boulder in the road when you and yours drive
home o’ nights—and your women-folk not safe at
any time——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no women-folk,” said Hardcastle—“except
old Rebecca. And she’s a match for any two of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Jake laboured to get the better of him. He
knew that, if he could persuade the Master of Logie
to buy peace at the small price of twenty ewes, the
Wilderness was free to go its way again, robbing the
weak, never needing to tackle stronger folk than ale-silly
drovers and the like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the house of Logie. They say no woman
could ever be to Hardcastle what Logie is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall come to burn it, on near night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks for the warning,” said Hardcastle, and
told Brant to get busy with the ewes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wiseman paused for a backward glance, and the
Master gripped his arm. “I’ll not hinder you either
way—but, Geordie, you’ve to choose once for all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Geordie, as his way was, went with those who
had prevailed in the last battle. And Brant went
driving the stolen ewes before him, more thankful
for them than for all the hundreds that had gone
before in safety. And Michael Draycott laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could scarce tell you why,” he said, answering
a question in the Master’s glance. “Perhaps I was
thinking of me on my death-bed, and the bonnier
times you kicked me up to share.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm, the sheep-slayer, watched it all from his
lair at the foot of Pengables. He saw the last of the
ewes go in a rainbow-steam round the wide curve
of the track, and with them Brant his enemy, and
Hardcastle his friend—his friend from this till death
ended loyalty for one unwanted dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The land grew quiet again, basking in the tranquil
heat, until a whistle broke the silence. Storm knew
the shepherd’s call, the whistle of hale farm-lads
when they climbed the pastures; but this had another
note. It was shrill and sinister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waited. Broken dogs, like broken men, learn
a patience that is not contentment—a patience wide-eyed
to observe all details and quick to interpret them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing happened for awhile, till the whistle was
repeated. And then Storm saw the doors of Garsykes
open wide, and men pour out from them and run into
the wide, green road the Logie Men had taken. He
saw Jake point first at their empty pinfold, then down
the track—heard the deep, evil roar that died as
they went grimly in pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm understood it all, and a great song came
into his blood. He was not concerned with his own
needs now, but with Hardcastle’s. As he went between
the brackens and kept pace with the running
folk below, he could see the men of Logie moving
slowly, hidden as yet from the enemy, but with only
a few hundred yards to spare. And they did not
know their peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The song in Storm’s blood had the gale’s speed
now. Like all great-hearted sinners, he was sick of
skulking. Reason had nothing to do with the long,
howling wail he gave—a wail like the cry of all the
lost who had ever lived and died in Garsykes—but
instinct told him he was serving Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle himself glanced backward, to learn the
meaning of it; and round the bend he saw a company
of the Lost Folk, their shuffling run stopped for a
moment by the eerie cry that still whined and sobbed
from the bracken-lands above. He took advantage
of their superstition—they fancied Guytrash was
calling them to death—and glanced ahead again,
down the track the sheep were taking over a grey,
narrow bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get the ewes over, Brant,” he said quietly, as if
he called him to supper up at Logie. “Get them over,
man, and be quick. We two must hold the bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sixty years of weather on the heights had only
toughened Brant’s lean body and he warmed to this
queer happening. He got the sheep across, and left
them in Geordie Wiseman’s charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your knees are all a-twitter, Geordie,” he growled,
“but there’s use enough in you, maybe, to keep a
few ewes from straying into what’s to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How will it end, shepherd?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it will end. What can I tell you more than
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Wilderness Men were still halting, for Storm’s
long-drawn howl had taken a deeper note. They
looked for some ghostly death to overtake them, till
Jake rallied their oozing pluck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s naught. We live too near those durned
old miners up at Weathersett, with their talk of
trolls and weir-dogs——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, but it’s Guytrash calling us, all the same,”
broke in a lad of the company. “I heard him once,
and my father hanged himself that night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The more fool he,” laughed Jake. “He’d have
been hanged any way, soon or late; but no man
should run to meet a halter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, fronting them at the bridge, knew that
the odds must overmaster himself and Brant, once
these folk came at them in dead earnest. They were
thirty paces away as yet, irresolute for a moment
that seemed endless, and Hardcastle’s thoughts ran
swiftly, like those of a drowning man. This end was
better, after all, than the long-drawn-out stealthy
warfare he had been prepared to meet. And Logie’s
honour would be safe. Yet he felt an odd, wistful
regret for Brant the shepherd. The pity of it that
Brant was old, with a heart reared on upland solitude.
The fights he was trained to share were clean battles
between a man and such weather as the skies chose
to ding about his ears. But they were here together
and must face it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant’s thoughts were busy, too, in this long moment
of inaction. The deep, running cry, that sounded
ceaselessly through the brackens up above, was a
cry known to him. It had roused him many a night
as he slept in his hut, up yonder on the roof of the
high fells, had got him out of doors with a gun in his
hand to follow a useless hunt in the dark for a sheep-slayer
who yapped and growled across the wastes.
He knew Storm’s voice now, as one knows the voice
of his dearest enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ewes behind him knew it, and pressed together
in a sweat of fright. Storm the sheep-slayer was
among them once again—Storm, who had made
nightmares of their slumber for time out of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hardcastle’s voice sounded, rough and sturdy,
as he answered Jake’s gibe that no man should run
to meet a halter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No man runs to meet my fists, I notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the Wilderness Men held back. Attack in
daylight was a trade they had not learned, and they
were clumsy at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle’s blood was red in him, as when he had
stood above old Roy, slain foully by these people.
The struggle could not last, he knew. Soon they
would gather bastard courage from force of numbers,
and there would be an end to him and Shepherd
Brant. But joy was with him. There was a sharp
memory of Logie, the house dearer to him than all else
except his lands. Parting was hard, till he remembered
that they would carry him there a true Hardcastle.
Dead or alive, he asked for Logie’s honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up above this battle that could only have one end,
Storm was pressing through the brackens. He had
warned the Master, and afterwards had watched the
score of grey-fleeced ewes. And the old wolf-call had
reached him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm went on his own business now. He went
at speed, but craftily, and never left cover till he
crossed the brook that, further down, ran under the
bridge where Hardcastle fronted the Lost Folk.
Then he turned downhill. He was in the open now,
and the sheep that fool Geordie guarded turned face
about as the slayer’s hunting-note came down the
lean, steep pasture-lands. They knew that Storm
loved to chase them from behind before at last he
leaped and fastened his teeth in wool and flesh. So
they turned about, with bleating courage to resist,
till the cry of the slayer came near and eager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geordie Wiseman pranced up and down, shouting
that the ewes were all gone daft. Hardcastle and
Brant turned to see the frenzied mob of sheep charge
them from behind; and just in time they left the
bridge. The sheep came skeltering over in resistless
panic, drove through the Wilderness Folk and scattered
them like chaff to one side and the other of the road.
Fear of man was lost in the wilder dread of what
pursued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After them came Storm, at a tearing gallop that
checked as he neared the Garsykes Men. The sheep
were in front of him, a sure quarry later on; and
here were enemies who had harried him up and down
the country-side for many a day. He bit right and
left with savage yelps. He paused to maul one here
and there of those who had been stamped into the
breeze-blown dust of the roadway. Then he passed,
as a roaring gale might do, and followed the grey
ewes—out and up, till he was hidden by a bluff of
rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Garsykes Men were broken. They forgot
Hardcastle at the bridge, forgot all but superstition,
and the look of Storm as he went by, with his fangs
bared and his muzzle dripping red with blood of theirs.
Terror-stricken as the sheep whose cries still came
fitfully down-wind, they made for home, some limping
as they went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle passed a hand across his eyes. A
moment since he had been ready for the struggle that
was to end all strife for him on this side of things;
and now he was a free man again. It was unbelievable
how sweet life was, with all its harsh ups-and-downs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant came to his side, and together they stood
looking down on the mean village in the hollow just
below them. It was packed with women, and one
of them—a plump, brazen hussy—sent a great laugh up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good grief, our men come home,” she cried—“<span class='it'>our
men</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The laughter spread, till the broken warriors rallied
and made for their own women-folk with ready fists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about time we went,” said Shepherd Brant.
“If the men and the women both come out against
us after their fratching’s done—why, God help us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took a last look at this village that had
conquered Logie-side for generations, and were turning
homewards when a voice hailed them, and they saw
the plump hussy breasting the rise of the pastures
up from Garsykes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re Hardcastle of Logie?” she panted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ve come to tell you two things. First,
that you’ve a queer pluck of your own, to come so
near us after we’ve put the token on Logie’s gate.
A bit of a fool, I should call you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like most of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood fronting them, her red arms folded across
her ample breasts. “Aye, laugh while you can; for it’s
no easy road you’ve chosen—’specially by night. Lord,
what our men will put on you for this day’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left them as quickly as she had come, and
Brant’s face was sombre as Hardcastle and he crossed
the bridge that would have seen their death if Storm
had not run wild awhile since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve lost twenty ewes. There’s no denying that,”
he grumbled. “And Storm—that old, ancient devil—is
with them up the pastures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He saved you and me, Brant—saved us for Logie
and the days to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were always partial to him, as I’ve told you
time and again. I’d rather have died than be saved
by a ravisher of ewes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe—but I’d rather live, to put fear of Logie
on these Garsyke swine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a mile they went, Hardcastle and his shepherd,
in sharp disagreement. Then Brant turned, with a
dry chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s sense in that. After the few hundred
years they’ve been putting fear on Logie, it’s time
we had our turn. But I cannot thole the thought o’
Storm, and never will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they rounded the bend where Widow Dyke’s
cottage stood snug and lonely, its garden-patch ablaze
with red butterflies that feasted on the tall-standing
Michaelmas daisies, Nita Langrish met them in the
road. A little, toddling chap had hold of her hand,
and she was singing a song to him.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>She ceased her singing, and stood fronting Hardcastle.
Supple and eager, a thing radiant as the sunlit
day, she brought harsh memories back. He had
been in slavery once to this beguilement, before he
learned what lay behind it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose brat have you with you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Widow Mathison’s.” Nita’s voice was clear and bell-like
as of old, pleasant to hear. “You felled his uncle
at the pinfold, and Murgatroyd has not recovered yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s welcome news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him with such hope of old
dominion that Brant went forward, disgruntled
and at war with life. If the Master liked to be
fooled a second time, that was no concern of a
shepherd who had kept his eyes on the hills, instead
of letting them rove women’s way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you forgotten Logie Woods?” asked Nita,
tears in her grey, pleading eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except in nightmare. Yes, I’ve forgotten those
days, Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bitter to the end?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and beyond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell to crying; and, when that did not serve,
she glanced at him through long, wet lashes. “If I
cared for too many men—it was vanity, and no more.
There was never a man but you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wrath came to Hardcastle—sudden, heedless
tempest, like a north wind from far, broken hills.
“I’ll not say to any woman what’s on my tongue for
you. I gave you—all Logie and myself—gave you
my heart to be held, or played with. Tales came of
other men, and I laughed at them—till I found them
true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was vanity. No man but you ever took my
lips—though many wanted to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was weaving gossamer about him, this once
again. Charm of the slender body, supple as the
willows she wove into her baskets—lilt of her voice—the
pleading in her eyes—were meshing him into
her net.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke through. The new days had hardened
him. Up yonder was threatened Logie; and here
was Nita of the Wilderness, wanting him not for
himself, but because he was the one man in the country-side
she could not play with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were singing a song to Widow Mathison’s
brat,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The feud with Logie’s up again. It came out
of the olden days, before I knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teach him a newer song. There’ll be no Garsykes
when the lad grows up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wrath had left him. Gruff and cold, sinewy with
field-sports and hard riding, he would never again
be the lover she had known. He was in the thick of
peril, and seemed to have no fear. He was within
reach of her hands and lips, and would not take them.
And now fury came to her in turn, though it ran deep
and out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are three things Hardcastle of Logie cared
for,” she said, counting them on slender fingers—“his
house, his dog Roy, his pride. And Roy has
gone the way of hemlock. So two are left him now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was you sent one of yours to Roy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And next I shall send one to fire your house,”
laughed Nita gently, counting the tally on her second
finger. “Then there’ll be stillness for a long while,
till your pride takes fright and dies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grew only a little harder. She had killed his
heart long since, and now had sent hemlock up to
Roy. And she was glancing at him with softened
eyes, was reaching out slim hands he would not take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have the Lost Folk at call—could turn the storm
from Logie, if—if you cared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle was no bondsman now to Garsykes Men—still
less to thraldom of any woman who thought to
glamour him from that side of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re asking tribute, Nita,” he said. “Logie
gives none to the Wilderness.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap08'>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<h3>THE GABBLE-RATCHET</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen was restless about the house of Logie.
Her father dozed and roused himself by turns.
Always in his waking moments he glanced
at the pike that had gone to Flodden Field and back,
and was eager to leave the roof that sheltered him.
She watched the same pitiful struggle to rise and get
his helpless limbs to ground, the same falling into
stupor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near sunset of the day that followed the ewe-gathering,
she drifted into Rebecca’s kitchen, pride
and weariness waging a private feud within her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is always the same tale, Rebecca,” she said.
“My father is not well enough to go just yet, and we
overstay our leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you that?” asked the other dryly, as she
gimped the edge of an apple-pasty before she set it
in the oven. “Not me for one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody told me—in so many words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca glanced up. The harsh face that was worth
a couple of watch-dogs to the house—as Hardcastle’s
jest had it—was softened now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re a stiff folk here, the Master and me. It’s
old habit to snap at foreigners—but once in a while
the snap doesn’t mean so much. You’re very welcome
to stay on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll let us pay,” said Causleen, fire smouldering
in her eyes. “We’re not beggar-folk, but pedlars—giving
for what we get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in a fine tantrum, are you? As if Logie
couldn’t give a lodging to a couple of far-spent wanderers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We haven’t money, but I could help you—to
wash up in the kitchen, and clean the upstairs rooms—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could,” broke in Rebecca, “if I’d let you.
You seem not to know that it’s joy and pride to me to
serve the Master. He’s worth the while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we must go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you must stay, seeing how it is with Donald.
You’ve enough to do, and so have I; and that should
keep us two from worriting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is the Master so hard?” asked Causleen,
watching Rebecca stand away from the hiss of the
opened oven-door before she put the pasty in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He met a fool-lass once, and thought her all made
up of what never could be in this world. Women
aren’t shaped out of rainbow-dreams, as the Master
fancied. So he took a fall—and a long, steep fall it
was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired as she was, Causleen’s interest was roused.
Woman-like, she saw Hardcastle’s gruffness softened
a little now that romance was its excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she bonnie, Rebecca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, like a bird you’d like to ’tice from its twig.
The devil uses that sort sometimes. And now there’ll
be no heir to Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll never marry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not he, unless the time of miracles came back.
I’ve no patience with life, I tell you. Here’s a man
as likely-set-up as one here and there—might pick as
he chose—and he lets himself go bachelor all his days
because a lass fooled him once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never thinks of the men before him? Seven
hundred years the Hardcastles have been settled here,
he told us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, he thinks of them, I fancy. They nag at
him, and small wonder. It’s a shame and a crying
pity that he should let the race die out, for sake of
such as Nita Langrish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was she like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like nothing honest—a face that put even women
in mind of flowers and such trash—and great, grey eyes—and
a heart as dry as Ghyll Beck after a droughty
summer. But she did one good turn to Logie. I’ll
own to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca had not paused in her work. Like a mill-wheel,
she could chatter without hindrance to the
day’s labour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They go far back, the Hardcastles,” she went on,
spreading dough on the baking-board and rolling it
with quiet, unhurried hands. “Yeomen, they, and
content with yeoman’s pride. Then they bought a
croft here, a farmhouse there, till they got to be big
in the land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen began to understand many things about
Hardcastle, now she held the key. His grim hostility
to women was explained. So, too, was the rugged,
inborn dignity that could meet all men frankly, yet
hold them at a little distance. In days gone by, she
had known Highland lairds who had shown just this
will-proud front to clansmen of the misty homeland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?” she added, like a child impatient for
the end of a nursery-tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There come breaks in a line as long as Hardcastle’s—a
spendthrift, a drunkard, one silly in his wits—there
must be breaks. The Lord Almighty favours
none, and long-settled folk must take their chances
with the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca was of the homeland, too, to Donald’s
girl. The Lord Almighty favoured none, as all men
knew who had lived with mountains and the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did a good turn to Logie, this Nita Langrish?”
asked Causleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did. The Master was all for guns and fishing,
and letting a farm go here and there while he played at
life. If the likes of her had married him, she’d have
pushed him down to dear-knows-what of mortgages
and ruin. But they quarrelled, thanks be, and the
Master went hard as a flint. I watched him close
and proper, I promise you, those first months after they
parted. It bit deep, and might have taken him into
any sort of devilment; but instead it stiffened him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soured and roughened him,” flashed Causleen, remembering
how Donald and she had come to Logie first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe. I own that I’d like to hear him laugh
about the house again—just once in the week, say—but
then you can’t have everything in this world.
Instead of squandering farms, he’s buying them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca, rolling the dough out as she talked, remembered
suddenly the pasty already in the oven, and
darted to its rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now,” she scolded, “it would have been
burned in another minute. That comes of your
gossip, when you know I like a quiet kitchen. Take
those white cheeks of yours out of doors, girl. You’ve
been cluttered up too long between four walls. Take
’em out, and leave me to my baking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen was learning the difference between the
bark and bite of those at Logie, and Rebecca’s glance
was kindly. “There is father,” she said, glancing wistfully
through the open door at the sunlit warmth outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And me to see to him till you come back. I’m
not old enough yet to make a song about tending my
kitchen and one ailing man. Take jobs by turns, and
one’s a rest from t’ other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Causleen, with a sob of sheer relief, stepped out
into the afternoon. She died by inches in such
imprisonment as she had known at Logie, but her feet
seemed shod with fairy-boskins now that she was free
to roam a land that reminded her at every turn of
her lost Highlands. Through the russet sun-glow she
went, up into the moors that knew no walls except the
sky’s. The heather was not as tall as in her own
country, where she had waded knee deep through it;
but the scent and the friendliness were the same.
When a cock-grouse got up and whirred over rise and
hollow of the untamed lands, she knew his challenge
of <span class='it'>go-back, go-back</span>, for a note as cheery as Rebecca’s
when she had bidden her find an hour of freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She left the moor at last, tempted by the lure of
Logie Woods below, with their burnished colours
glowing in the heat-haze; and once more, as she
stepped into their cool shelter, the sense of home was
with her. Underfoot the pale gold of fallen larch-leaves
shimmered softly in the silver light that filtered
through—a thick carpet, soft to tread. Ripe, nutty
odours were abroad, and peace was sounding her
elfin-trumpets through every brake and hollow. The
wise big-hearted autumn was here, as in far Inverness—a
northern autumn, that had fought for this tranquillity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, in sheer content, followed the winding
track, till it led her to a little, brawling stream, brown
with moor-peat and ferned in every crevice of its banks
with greenery for the water-pixies and their kind.
She forgot every footsore step she had taken on the
Pedlar’s Road. Here was the twin-hollow to one in
the homeland, where she had grown from child to
woman, dreaming of Highland feuds, and Highland
loves, and the glamour that would come one day when
a man’s eyes were steady and honest with her own,
asking all she had to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood there, so quiet that a squirrel ran about
her feet before he saw her and raced up a neighbouring
fir-bole, pausing to wash fear away from his face before
he glimpsed down on this intruder. As on Logie
Brigg, no longer than two weeks ago, Causleen was
aware now of the voice that spoke without any sort
of speech—the little voice within that never lied. Not
in the Highlands, but here in Logie-land, the man of
her dreams would come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So by and by she went down the rough bank of the
stream, singing a Gaelic song that was in tune with the
water’s voice, and came at last to the brink of Wharfe
River, where it flowed in dappled, sunlit quiet—a
great-bosomed stream, wide between its banks. And
now she lost remembrance of the Highlands. They
had rivers there in plenty, but none like this water
that said so little and so much as it swirled by—lonely,
majestic, unafraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She, who had learned in babyhood the language
of many waters, big and little, could make nothing of
Wharfe’s speech. Soft as its murmur was, there were
undernotes that baffled her—eerie cries below the
flood, and now and then a roaming whine, as if a fox
pursued its prey by night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A breeze was stealing now across the warm shelter
of the woods—a moaning breeze, gentle and very cold.
The rock-doves, crooning overhead, grew silent.
Chatter of beast and bird ceased in Logie Woods.
They knew what was coming to them from the north
and something of their trepidation began to settle on
Causleen. Such dreams as she had been weaving
a moment since seemed empty, foolish, and their
warmth had gone with the woodland glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wharfe River, as she followed it, lost its breadth of
flow; its tranquil temper. The under-cries grew
louder as it swept through the narrows under grey-brown
scuds of foam; and ever as the waters hurried
down, the rocks on either bank set closer teeth on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, glancing across this place of tumbled strife,
saw a man’s figure come down the wood on the far
bank; and a smile of self-derision played about her
lips. How bravely she had dreamed of a lover—and
what a wakening, to find Hardcastle of Logie—Hardcastle
the churl, who grudged Donald and herself
each hour they spent under his roof. But at least he
was on the other bank, and there was no bridge for
him to cross. She was glad of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she saw him gather himself together, and run
a little way, and leap; and he was on her side now of
Wharfe River, laughing up at her astonished face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It saves the long way round by Logie Brigg,” he
said—“but it’s no short cut for fools to take.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came close to the bank and glanced down,
curious to learn how one leap could bridge a river; and
under her she saw the whole tumult of the upper stream
caged into a yard’s span, with Wharfe going silent, fast
and deep between its prison walls. She saw, too, that
Hardcastle had jumped from the low to the higher
bank, and that the rock he leaped from was wet with
spray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You took a mad risk,” she said, shivering as she
watched the strong, remorseless flood go by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said it was no short cut for fools. But Wharfe
couldn’t drown me if she tried. There’s too long
caring goes between us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Wharfe River.</span> The name sings to me since I
heard it first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Wharfe sings—many songs. I’ve known her
for thirty years, and never stale of listening. Soft as
a girl one day, and the next a beldame, riving all her
banks to pieces. A woman, all of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—a woman?” asked Causleen, with quiet
mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She changes her mind so lightly—croons to you,
like the gentlest stream that ever lapped quiet banks—and
you’re half believing it when the storm-waters
come, roaring to pluck you down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it only Wharfe taught you what you know of
women?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malice prompted the gibe, but Causleen was bewildered
by the answering fury. She had driven a needle-point
into some deep-hidden nerve, and for a moment
she fancied Hardcastle would strike her. He was
alive with rage. She seemed to stand shelterless under
a mountain tempest that was soon to break about her.
She did not care. Better to flout him in the open
here than be a tongue-tied and unwelcome guest
at Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she had watched him gather himself for the
slippery leap across the Strith, she watched him now.
He got temper into hand, as if it were a mettled horse
he rode. He conquered the pain of an old wound
she had pricked to life. The face he turned to her at
last was grey and quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not only Wharfe,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze came sobbing, cold and comfortless,
through the woods of Logie, and the red leaves blew
about them in their fall. Again old griefs came to
Hardcastle, and again he laughed, as of old, to drive
them off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wharfe’s a woman, as I said. She drowned the
heir of all these lands once—a stripling, and his greyhound
checked him at the leap. And then his mother
reared the Priory below; and Wharfe slips by the ruins
to this day, gentle as a dove—penitent, you’d think,
for what she did up here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen’s interest was stirred, in spite of herself,
by the boldness of his fancy, the sure, straightforward
hold he had on the lore of other days. At their first
coming, when Donald resented the pike hung on the
wall at Logie, the Master spoke of Flodden as if he
had shared the battle lately. Now he talked of what
happened in the elder years, before the shock of Flodden
came, as if they, too, were recent. To-day seemed one
with all the yesterdays to this man who loved his
country-side and knew its inner secrets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeze blew shriller now. Raw and wet, it
fluted through the glory of the woods, plucking a red
leaf here and there in passing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brant was right,” said Hardcastle, “though I
fancied his weather-wisdom had gone astray this once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, and while Causleen was thinking bitterly
that the prophet of ill-weather was always on the safe
side of life, a great crying sounded overhead—a harsh,
tortured crying, as of human things in anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rebecca would say it was The Gabble-Ratchet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first crying overhead had passed into silence,
but now another came, louder and more anguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brant was right,” Hardcastle repeated—“and it’s
time we both got up to Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found herself going with him up the steep rise
of the woods—found herself yielding a hand to his
when he reached down to help her across some slippery
rock-face—and had no time to wonder that she let
her pride be quiet. There was something in the wet,
rising breeze, something in the Gabble-Ratchet uproar
overhead not long since, that made for awe and need
of a man’s hand, whether he was rich or poor in courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went past Ghyll House, where a dog barked at
them from behind a stable-door, and up into the
pastures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant was right, no doubt, as Hardcastle had said.
On one side of them, Pengables thrust his big rock
shoulders up into the red sundown and the warmth;
on the other a grey mist came running, like the ewes
that Storm had chased into the Wilderness a few days
since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now again there sounded the crying from above,
shrill and terrible, and Causleen looked up to see what
seemed a ship go overhead with the speed of a hurricane
behind. It was a long, slender ship, its slenderer prow
driving into the sunlit warmth ahead, and it was
chased by the breeze that was a wind by now, hurrying
the grey mists in front of it. Then Causleen came out
of the eeriness that Logie Woods had laid on her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the wild-geese flighting south,” she said,
shaking herself free of omens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” said Hardcastle; “and so many of them
come that we’ve time to get to Logie and no more.
Lord Harry only knows what sort of storm is skelping
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They two knew what sort of storm it was, when
they reached the long pasture that raked up into the
Logie highroad. The wind came, and the snow, and
biting hail—came ravening on the track of the wild-geese
fleeing south—and soon there were no landmarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a foresters’ hut, he remembered, at
his left hand, where the field ran into the pinewoods.
They could find shelter there, if anything could
find it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had known the pasture from childhood,
but it was lost to him as if he trod foreign country.
In the blackest night he could have found his way
across it, but not through this scudding snow that
swirled till it dizzied brain and sight—through the
wind that bit and the hail that stung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not making now for Logie. There was a
foresters’ hut at the far end of the pasture where it
met the pinewoods. Once he could find it they could
shelter till the snow had ended; for tempests as
quick to come as this, out of a warm October’s quiet,
seldom lasted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not find the hut—could find nothing but
snow that was balling already under his feet—snow
that would not let the sky come through. It was
as if he tried to make way through a thicket, not of
brambles, but of cotton-wool. Then a cry reached
him. Whether it came from front or rear, he could
not tell, but it was Causleen’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you, child?” he snapped, impatient
at his own failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little sob ran in between one wind-gust and the
next. It hurt him strangely. “Lost. I was tired—I
could not keep pace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was lost indeed, though no more than ten
paces from him. For the wind got up with a screech,
and there seemed no space between the snowflakes.
And over the din of it all there sounded, far overhead,
the crying of belated wild-geese, hurrying south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in that moment of harsh peril, Hardcastle
laughed quietly. It was odd that he, of all men,
should be asked to go seeking about for a woman
lost in the snow. These five years past he had been
striving to lose all women, except Rebecca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voice answering voice, they strove to find each
other. Sometimes they came near, and again they
called through the sundering distance. And then at
last Hardcastle touched the rough pedlar’s cloak she
wore, and reached down, and got her hand into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more straying,” he said roughly, “till we
get out of this damned weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand lay close in his. He did not know that
his own gripped it till she winced. He knew only
that he must get her free of this pasture that would put
the snow-sleep on them if they stayed much longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen’s hand seemed in some strange way to
guide him. He moved quickly, like one who knew
his way at last, and presently his knees came hard
against a fence of stone. He had not guessed till
now that bruised knees could be a joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your hand in mine,” he said, “while I feel
my way by the wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a weary enterprise, this feeling the way.
The wind was a gale now, and Hardcastle’s hand
followed the wall as a blind man’s might, with slow
caution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together they trudged through the thickening
snow till Hardcastle’s numbed fingers touched something
that was not stone. He had found the rough
trunk of the oak-tree that stood this side of the
foresters’ hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” he said, and clambered up the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this whiteness that was worse than midnight,
he could not see where to plant his feet. And, as
is the way of dry-built walls, the stones went under
him with a roar like the wind’s note overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are hurt?” came Causleen’s voice—tattered
to bits by the wind as she tried to repeat the frightened
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One foot was bruised by a coping-stone of the wall.
He could attend to that later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said. “I’ve made a gap for you to come
through. That is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached out both hands to draw her up the
half-fallen wall; and, as she climbed the opening,
the gale drove her full into Hardcastle’s arms. He
held her fast, and so they came, he carrying her, along
one side of the hut, and round the corner of it, and
into shelter of its lee-wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow lay thick on either hand. Overhead the wind
was yelping. But there was a clear space in front
of them, and the relief from battering of the tempest
was instant, as if they had stepped from winter into
June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you will free me,” said Causleen, with quiet
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had forgotten that he still held her in
his arms. He was thinking how nearly they had
tasted death while they tramped up and down a
pasture known to him from boyhood. If he had
not found the wall in time to guide himself by it,
there would have been rejoicing out at Garsykes;
but the Lost Folk had not done with him as yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door stood half-open. Sometimes the foresters
locked it, but oftener not; and Hardcastle took it
for a good omen that it was ajar to-day. There
would be no need to set a shoulder to it and break
it inward. There was a ready welcome for them
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he thought, till he pushed the door wide-open,
and was challenged roughly. As he had battled to
win free of tempest, it seemed he would have to fight
for this shelter of the hut. He put Donald’s girl
still further behind him and took a pace or two indoors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down, you brute,” he said. “Down, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hardcastle, to his amazement, heard the
savage growling cease, and felt a rough snout pushed
into his hand; and presently he came from the dimness
of the hut into the grey gloom of the space that
had snow overhead, and snow to left and right. He
held Storm by the collar, because he knew his ways
were sharp with strangers nowadays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve the sheep-stealer safe. What shall we do
with him?” he asked with grim banter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm strained at his collar—to be at Causleen’s
throat, he fancied, until the girl ran forward, and
took the great, rough muzzle into her hands, and
kissed him with frank abandonment. The dog
licked her face, and after that licked Hardcastle’s.
And the wind roared overhead; and here, on the lee side
of the hut, was sanctuary for these three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To kiss a dog with his reputation up and down
Logie-side,” said Hardcastle, and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen had not known that he could laugh in this
easy, heart-free way. Till now he had seemed austere
as destiny—relentless as the driven snow they sheltered
from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not for the first time—is it, Storm?” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, when they got indoors, knew his way
about the hut—knew where to find the candles, the
fuel, the demijohn of rum, hidden snugly under the
slab that fronted the rough fireplace built of stone.
A great blaze of wood and fir-cones was roaring up
the chimney soon, and Causleen thanked him for
it. Their journey up the pasture had been short in
time, but long in suffering, and she was sick with
cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She almost cried to him to come back when she saw
him open the door and go out, and was glad when
he returned. It would have been lonely here without
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had only gone to fill a kettle from the
snowdrift, and soon this was purring on the fire.
She loathed the smell of the brew he offered her by
and by—rum piping-hot in one of the foresters’ mugs—and
turned her head away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe not; but physic’s better than your death
of cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She loathed the taste of it, too, though presently
she was glad of obedience to compulsion. This
physic, nauseous enough, had a strange gift of bringing
warmth and well-being. She no longer shivered.
The strain of that rough journey through the tempest
was eased and mellowed, and already half-forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three of them took their fill of ease. The gale
out of doors grew harsher. It raved and screeched,
falling back on itself once every while in whining,
baffled spite. And they knew that, outside their
four walls, the snow was driving thick from Pengables
out to Logie, burying sheep and men, making a jest
of landmarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle and the girl had fought the gale, and
won. By no other road could they have found the
joy in listening to its fury while they hugged the
fireglow. But neither guessed what Storm was
making of the respite. Like them, the sheep-stealer
had battled through the tempest, and found refuge
here; but for him it was only one of many nights,
with danger lying in wait at every turn. Here he
was safe and warm, and in his sleep he gave little,
snoring cries of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you two grow friendly?” asked Hardcastle,
stirring the dog lazily with one foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the night we came to Logie. They called
you into the kitchen, and while you were away the
illness came on father. I could do nothing for him
except watch beside him while he slept.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I heard a dog’s feet patter down the passage,
and afterwards a lonely sobbing. And I found Storm
in the cupboard under the stair, crying his big heart
out. I was lonely, too, and he knew it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know much of dogs,” said the Master, with
grudging praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to know more—and less of my own
kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re young, to be so hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint smile crossed her face. “And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m old as the hills. A man needs to be
hard, or what’s the use of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned to pile fresh logs on the fire, a lull
came in the tempest, and Storm lifted his head sharply
from his lazy, stretched-out paws. Some sound had
stolen from the snow outside that only he could
hear. He got up, whining and growling by turns
as he laid his nose to a crack in the door. Then he
yapped, and after that he howled; and Hardcastle,
who had thought of opening the door to learn who
came, thought better of it. He knew what the wolf-cry
meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame on you, lad,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire went out of Storm. His tail drooped.
He cringed about this new master of his choice;
and, when no blow came, he settled himself by the
hearth again and slept. But now he had muddled
dreams for company.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap09'>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<h3>THE NIGHT WATCH</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As the hours passed, the tempest gained in speed.
Stout-built as it was, the foresters’ hut shook
with the gale’s mishandling, and the din out of
doors was as full of cries as if every warlock and hellhound
had been loosed from Langstrothdale to Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen and Hardcastle sat on the rough benches
built on each side of the hut. They faced each other
across the fireglow, and between them Storm slept on,
making the most of luxury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be fierce, but could not last at this time of
the year,” said Causleen, with grave, accusing anger.
“You promised that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And could not keep the promise. I’m only the last
fool who thought himself a prophet where Logie weather
was concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the snow has stopped—go see if the snow has
stopped—I should not care for the wind, however hard
it blew. We could get up to Logie somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were bright—too bright, to Hardcastle’s
thinking—and she seemed to have some stubborn feud
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can we, through the drifts? Be glad we’re
sheltered here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a man at all? I bade you go and see if
we could get to Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To humour her, he went out and looked about him.
There was a clear space still in front of the sheltered
doorway, and little stir of wind. The hut lay in a little
harbour of its own, secure; but a little space away the
gale ravened through the snow as Storm at his reddest
had never harried the grey ewes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The snow thickens,” he said, coming in again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there is nothing we can do to get to Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quarrel showed in her eyes again. “A beggar-maid’s
honour is of no account. It would not be, to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her with puzzled question. To him,
this was an adventure thrust on him by the tricky
weather, and he would be glad to see the end of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your honour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are so dull, you men of Logie. It’s not you I
doubt. I trust you—dear God, as I’d trust an oak-tree,
or a stone. But they will say——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faltered, ashamed of her thought, dismayed by
their imprisonment, bitterly resentful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>They say</span>,” snapped Hardcastle, “is the biggest
fool in the Dale. He’ll not hurt us much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not understand. Why did you bring
me here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Would you rather be lying in the
pasture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was angered afresh by the knowledge that she
owed her life to him, by the tolerant wonder in his
face, as if he had a child’s absurdities to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I would rather be lying there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faced him with frank enmity, and was silent for
awhile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have your Logie Women no nice sense of honour?”
she went on. “Are they not taught that the least
breath on it is worse than death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are,” said the Master, stung into defence of
his own—“and with it they’re taught common-sense.
Logie thinks none the worse of two folk because a
blizzard keeps them safe indoors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had been a Hielandman, and I’d said to him
half of what I’ve said to you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d have been fighting the drifts outside by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The challenge was direct—out-facing if he did not
take it up—and Hardcastle glanced at Storm, asleep
still between them. The dog would be a sure guardian
for her, if he failed. It was likely he would fail; but
there was just a chance that he could win through to
some other shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He searched in the chest at the far side of the hut,
where the woodmen kept their axes and sundry tools,
and found a shovel. Then without a word he went out,
closing the door behind him, and paused a moment to
frame a plan before he left the narrow belt of shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trees, instead of giving protection to the ground
below, were gathering even deeper drifts than the naked
pastures. In such a storm as this, their branches—full
leaved almost as in summer—trapped the snow and
held it till some fiercer wind-blast sent it scattering
down. There was no chance on that side; but there
was hope if he could work round to the wall that made
one side of the hut. Once he reached that, its whole
length would give him the same narrow strip of freedom
from wind and snow that the hut was giving him now.
Afterwards he might travel, on the lee side of this and
other walls, until he reached some barn or other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether the plan failed or carried, he told himself
grimly, Causleen’s good-repute would go white as the
swirling storm. She would be found with a grizzled
sheep-stealer for guardian, not with him; and maybe
her restless pride would be content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of his disdain for women—out of the slur she had
put on all but Highland men—endurance came to him.
Between himself and the wall he sought, a great bulk
of snow lay at the corner of the hut, and he drove at it
with his shovel. For the honour of Logie Men he must
get through it, and give the pedlar’s chit her answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The drift could not be more than a few yards thick,
he knew, and he worked hopefully in a lull of the wind.
Suddenly, from the white mass in front, came faint
voices raised in protest, and he remembered what Storm
had heard not long since. There were over-blown
sheep in the drift here—part, maybe, of the flock that
Storm had hunted yesterday—and work had a double
zest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gale had given him respite in mockery. It
swooped on him afresh with a whistling screech,
so that he could scarcely stand to ply his shovel.
Drenched from within by sweat, the snow fell icy on
him from the branches overhead—fell on the track he
was carving, foot by foot, towards the drifted ewes,
and half undid his labour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he toiled, though passionate desire for sleep had
joined the company of his enemies. There seemed no
heaven but one, here or hereafter—a bed in this snow
he strove to master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, after she had watched him go, felt the
same loneliness, the same longing to call him back, as
when—years ago, it seemed—he had gone to get a
kettleful of snow. She was filled with a great unrest,
a wonder that she had chosen to drive him out. What
had he done, except give her a roof there at Logie, and
here in this warm hut?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm was uneasy, too. He got up and flicked a
flea or two away from a hide that had known fouler
quarters than the hut, and whined about the door.
Then he glanced back at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to the door and opened it. As Hardcastle
had done, she halted, watching the snow, listening to
the gale that ceased for a moment and let a man’s
voice through—a harsh, fighting voice. While she
stood, reluctant to plunge into the white hurricane,
Storm showed the way to her. Already snow had
drifted over the lane Hardcastle had carved; and they
found him at the corner of the hut, battling forward for
the last yard that would take him to the lee-wall’s shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the wind lulled, and Causleen was aghast to
hear the deep, stubborn curses of this man she had sent
out to battle. In simple earnest he was fighting the
snow-sleep; but in fancy it was Garsykes and its devilry
he fought. As he made forward, inch by inch, he
cursed Nita Langrish, rained blows again on the three
gaunt men who had met him at the pinfold; and Causleen
could not remember afterwards how she and Storm
got him safely back at last to the hut’s shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They got him back, and for a while he lay in a dazed
sleep, past this world’s ken. Then little by little he
forced himself—by sheer will to fight on, it seemed—into
wakefulness. He glanced at Causleen—at the fire
she had replenished—at grey, old Storm, nosing his knee
in quiet distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How nightmare plays the devil with a man,” he
laughed. “I fancied I was shovelling snow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dozed again, and Causleen watched beside him.
She had taunted him; but it seemed there was one man
at least in Logie-side. And he might have died while
going her errand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night wore on. Storm was asleep, too, but she
sat wakeful, and listened to the dying tempest. The
window of the hut was not blurred by snowflakes now.
The wind no longer roared in glee; it wailed and sobbed,
like a child left out in the dark. Strange noises
sounded out of doors—soft, thick splashings that she
knew by and by for melting snow shed by the forest
trees—and across the window-space a keen, sharp
radiance stole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawn must be here, she thought. Yet anger against
him, her fear of gossip, showed unworthy. She was
here with the realities of the big, open lands, and she
smiled, recalling Hardcastle’s rough “<span class='it'>They say</span> is the
biggest fool in the Dale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to the window again, glad of the moonlight
that meant the end of tempest; and, as she sat
there, her whole body suddenly grew tense and her eyes
wide with terror. She could not cry to Hardcastle for
help. Tongue and limbs seemed chained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Framed by the moonlight, a white, big face looked
in at her—a face packed with evil—and then was gone.
Hardcastle heard nothing, nor did Storm; but Causleen
listened to the slushing scrunch of feet going over
melted snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That sound ceased, and the door was opened warily
till it stood open to the moonlight and the fireglow.
And still Causleen could not stir, or cry a warning; and
Storm snored on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Hardcastle who woke. With a bound he was
up. Murgatroyd, dazed for a moment by the unexpected
greeting, turned just in time, and ran, and
clashed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle followed, Storm silent as he raced behind
the Master. The two of them went forward, over slush
of the melting snow, under the scudding Hunter’s
Moon; but Long Murgatroyd was part of the snowy
wilderness by now, lost beyond the night’s finding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came back unwillingly, and to Causleen it
seemed that Hardcastle had never shown his true self
till now. Smeared with sweat and weariness, limping
on the foot bruised by the coping-stone, his eyes were
bright as a lad’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can get to Logie now,” he said—“and it’s time
we went, after losing Long Murgatroyd. He may be
dodging out to Garsykes, to bring the Wilderness on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full moonlight shone on the fast melting snow as they
went out. A warm breeze stole against their faces.
Winter’s journey to the Dale had been hurried, alike
in coming and going, as if she feared her welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the corner of the hut, where the drift had been,
there was no more than a slender bank of snow, with
rivulets playing down its sides. A shovel lay in front
of it, and for the first time Hardcastle recalled, with a
sudden rush of memory, how he had struggled here in a
wind that bit to the bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm’s nose was buried already in the slush. He
scented the oily reek that spoke of hunting-days, past
and to come; and when he drew his head back and
glanced up at the Master, there was wistfulness in his
brown eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone away,” laughed Hardcastle. “You’d best
come up to Logie, out of Brant’s reach.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap10'>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<h3>THE WEAVER OF BASKETS</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Before the storm broke that drove Causleen
and Hardcastle into shelter of the foresters’
hut, Long Murgatroyd had been poaching up
the moor. He knew all about the uses of a wire
looped at both ends and set across the tracks the
grouse took to their drinking-places; and he laughed
as he gathered his spoils together and turned for home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re Hardcastle’s birds,” he chuckled, “and
they’ll taste sweeter in the pot for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had got half down the moor when the first of
the tempest struck him, and he ran for the lower
country as fast as his great legs would take him.
He reached the first pasture only to be blinded by
the swirl of snow, so that he had to creep forward,
feeling his way. His hands touched stone at last,
and he worked his way round to the lee side of a
bield-wall, built two-sided to shelter ewes from the
north wind and the bitter east. In the angle of this
he dozed and shivered through the storm; and
afterwards, when the moon shone out on thawing
snow, he picked and slushed his way downhill to
Garsykes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His way lay past the foresters’ hut, and as he
went by he halted, astonished to see its window
shining crimson out across the snow. Peering in,
he saw Causleen there beside the hearth, and no
one else. Drenched to the skin, hungry and shivering,
Long Murgatroyd laughed—as he had laughed when
he snared Hardcastle’s birds on the moor. There
was shelter here, and a log-fire, and a lass to share
the warmth with him—a bonny lass, and a prime
favourite up at Logie these last days, if all folk said
was true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door, to find Hardcastle rise in
menace, to see Storm bristling at him in rage that
seemed gigantic. He banged the door home and
fled. By instinct of the hunted he knew they would
catch him in this hindering broth of snow and water.
So he doubled back into the wood. The snow made
silence under his feet. The black firs hid him from the
moon. He was lost utterly to Hardcastle and Storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd watched the moon pale in the dawning
sky, and the sun leap ruddy to the top of old Pengables
Hill, before he came in sight of Garsykes. It was a
tedious way for one spent with fright and hunger,
and he lumbered down into the hollow, and looked
about him at the closed doors of the village—especially
at the inn-sign, “The Poacher’s Rest,” that swayed
cracked and dirty in the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went in at last, and a flaunting, big-breasted
woman answered his call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ye, Long Murgatroyd!” she said, her arms
akimbo. “What d’ye want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dollop of rum, and summat to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Widow Mathison pointed to a row of figures on
the door. “Nay, you’ll ruin me. I’m for ever chalking
up your slate till I’m tired of you and your debts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd drew out a brace of grouse from some
hidden pockets and slapped them on the table.
“Keep ’em awhile, widow, till they’re like to drop
to bits. You relish ’em that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardcastle’s birds? Ay, they’ll be toothsome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She busied herself now, with entire goodwill, about
the fire; and Murgatroyd looked up by and by from
a steaming dish of eggs and bacon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d wipe out your chalks against me, widow,
if I told you what I saw in Logie Woods. But, there,
I’m not for telling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did ye see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, another noggin o’ rum wouldn’t draw it
from me. There was Hardcastle of Logie in the woodmen’s
hut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there?” asked the widow, filling his glass afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd took a wide gulp at the measure, and
drained it. He was cold and weary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if you filled it afresh—and thank you, widow,
for it does drive the wet out o’ one’s bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardcastle was in the hut,” said the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, he was, in front of a cosy fire, and the pedlar’s
lass with him, sitting on his knee. I saw ’em through
the window as I went by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Widow Mathison gave a screech of glee. “For a
woman-hater, he frames fairish well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fairish well,” agreed Murgatroyd, with a maudlin
leer. “There she was, and there he was. You
wouldn’t say aught could alter that—would you,
now? I opened the door, and I listened—and dang
me if they weren’t cooing like a pair o’ cushats. And
she a pedlar’s brat. And him with his mucky pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door swung open, and a squat fellow entered,
sallow-faced and touzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s water in plenty hereabouts,” said the
widow, after a shrewd glance at him; “but it seems
to run to waste. One man could lead Jake Bramber
to it, but twenty couldn’t make him wash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t thinking of water specially,” growled
Jake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t be. It’s the itch i’ your throat
that bothers you at this time o’ day. And there’s
your tally, side by side with Murgatroyd’s. I’m tired
of chalking up your owings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s easy mended, widow. Stop chalking ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bridled at his effrontery, but drew him a
measure. Then, “Tell him, Murgatroyd,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd told him what he had seen in the
foresters’ hut, and with repetition the tale gathered
volume, till all the Garsykes swine had garbage to
wallow in for many a day to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita Langrish will laugh herself to bits when she
hears this,” said Jake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure,” broke in the widow. “Nita
may fool you men of Garsykes—<span class='it'>if</span> you’re men, which
I begin to doubt—but Hardcastle escaped her. So
she wants him. I’ve known her since she toddled,
and that was always her way. Near died o’ crying
for the moon, when she was three years old. It’s
always the thing she hasn’t Nita longs for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true,” snarled Jake. “Awhile since she
was making her baskets on the Brigg. ‘Jake,’ says
she, ‘you’ve a way with dogs.’ ‘I have,’ says I.
‘It’s a birth-gift. They like as they love me, same as
if I was one o’ them.’ And then she told me to put
hemlock into a ball o’ meat and take it up to Logie.
Hardcastle’s dog would be waiting for him at the
gate, said Nita. So I went, and friendlied Roy. And
I was a sick man, I tell you, coming home. To
poison a dog—it doesn’t bide thinking of—but Nita
made me do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd rose suddenly to his big, shammocky
height. He was shaken by a storm of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s the devil and all among us, with her basket-making
and her eyes on all four sides at once to fool
us. I’ve done with Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the widow. “You’ve never done with
such as Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now feet began to patter up and down the
cobbled street. Garsykes Folk were late to wake,
for their work lay mainly with night-time tasks of
poaching and robbery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman beckoned Long Murgatroyd out of
doors. He followed her with unsteady, shambling
feet, and soon they had a company of unwashed folk
about them, listening to the widow’s ribald laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s news from Logie,” she said. “Tell ’em,
Murgatroyd, as you told it Jake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd propped himself against the wall,
and looked about him with a clown’s solemnity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s about Hardcastle o’ Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn him,” snarled a thin, wolfish man. “He
goes abroad as if we’d put no token on him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you worry, my lad,” said Murgatroyd.
“We’ll know where to find him nowadays. He’ll
not wander far from pedlar’s brat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then he told them what he believed by now
that he had seen in the foresters’ hut; and such a
storm of applause greeted him that he left the friendly
shelter of the wall behind him, and talked at large
as he strutted to and fro across the street. No tale
such as this had come to Garsykes for many a year,
and for the moment they half-liked the Master of
Logie, because he was a backslider like themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the tale was done, and the folk began to
get about their ways, Nita Langrish came among
them. Used as they were to her young beauty,
going among them from day to day, they never ceased to
marvel that such as she had grown out of Garsykes mire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fresh from her morning bath in a pool she knew
of up the fells, gowned in soft grey that clung about
her slender body, she stood like a creature from some
other world among the tattered women of the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there news from Logie?” she asked, in her
pleasant voice. “They told me Hardcastle would
be up the moor yesterday, so I persuaded one of ours
to take an errand for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not what you might call news from
Logie,” laughed Widow Mathison, “but Murgatroyd
here has word of Hardcastle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd faced her, and old hunger, old
dismay found sudden vent. “He’s out of your
reach, Nita,” he snarled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He always was,” said Nita gently, “after I sent
him out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Same as you’ve sent all of us, one by one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you tried to come too close.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood there, soft as this morning that followed
a night of grim tempest—a radiant thing, knowing
herself mistress of them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well. Hardcastle’s tied to another apron-string.
She’s a bonnie lass, too, as I glimpsed her in the
woodmen’s hut. They made a picture, sitting by the
fire as if they’d set up housekeeping together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wild-rose flush leaped to Nita’s cheeks. “Who
was it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pedlar’s lass. He’s chosen dark and trusty
this time, as the saying is. None of your yellow-haired
women again for him, says Hardcastle—and
I don’t wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita took up the challenge. “You saw them in
the hut?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye. I opened the door to creep in for shelter,
and Hardcastle was there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you ran for your life? To be sure, you’d
not forget what he did to you at the pinfold. None
of your masters of Logie again for you, if you can
help it—and I don’t wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mimicry, the quickness of her answer, raised
such a storm of laughter against Murgatroyd that
he gave up the contest; but presently he followed,
as she went by the field-track that led to Logie Brigg,
and overtook her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita, my lass,” he said, “you’ve got to stay
and listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, like it or no, you have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his face she saw the baffled hunger that she
had brought to many men. His voice was rough
and harsh, but there was pleading in it—a headstrong
pleading that it was her life’s delight to thwart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this way. I’m sick and tired o’ my days.
Naught matters, save you—you and your devilments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve baskets to weave. All up and down the
Dale they’re asking for Nita’s baskets. There’s no
time to care for men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put out a savage hand, to draw her to him.
She did not seem to spring aside, yet suddenly she
stood far away, putting her smiling spells on him
afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita,” he said, sombre and hungry-eyed, “I’m
not of the fanciful sort; but summat or somebody
is whispering at my ear. One of us two is going to
die of your devilry—and I don’t care a tinker’s damn
which it is, so long as it comes soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across Nita’s young vigour, her joy in torturing
men for pastime, a little, cold wind began to play.
Long Murgatroyd was sobered. He was in dead
earnest, and his big, uncouth face was lit as with
some fire of prophecy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then her mood passed. “It will be you to die
of it, I think,” she said, and laughed at him as she
took her way to Logie.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca was busy in her kitchen up at Logie on
the afternoon of the great snowstorm. She was
thinking how wise she had been to send Causleen
“just to get a bit of colour into her cheeks” when
the sky began to darken, till she could scarcely have
seen to ply her rolling-pin but for the ruddy hearth-glow.
Now and then she turned on the great, brindled
cat curled up inside the fender</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a grand ’un for bringing bad weather,”
she said, “and that’s why I named you Jonah. You
never sit close to the fire but it means a storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cat stretched himself, and licked his handsome
fur, and dozed again. It was odd to him that human
folk had so little knowledge of weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just Jonah, you—and an idle vagabones at that
I’ve a mind to sweep you out of my kitchen with
the thick end of a besom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jonah heard the threat without disturbance. He
knew the way of Rebecca’s weather, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on with her pastry-making. The Master
had a big body to be filled, and a sweet tooth for
pastry after he’d had his fill of strong meats. Men
were all alike. Feed ’em and fill ’em, and they’d
be lambs about a house. And Rebecca never guessed
why her hand was light at the work—and the pastry
light, by that token. She had never a man to care
for, except Hardcastle of Logie, and it was a joy
to wear herself to the bone for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind got up and snarled, as it snarled by the
Strith when Hardcastle and Causleen listened to the
vanguard of the storm piping low through Logie
Wood. And then there came the crying of the wild-geese,
winging high above the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca dropped her rolling-pin, and went out into
the wind-gusts and the greying light. She was at
prayer, of her own sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Gabble-Rachet always brought me luck,”
she said. “It’s that I live for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flight after flight went overhead, with ceaseless uproar.
Rebecca was no longer the practical, deft-handed
housekeeper at Logie. She was as Causleen
and old Donald had seen her, when the pedlar showed
baby-wear among the litter of his pack, and she went
wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought of the lad who was to have married
her in the far-off time, of his death because he would
pay no toll to Garsykes. The man who killed him
had died while the Gabble-Ratchet screeched overhead.
Years afterwards his son broke his neck to
the self-same music. Luck was in for her, and out
for Garsykes, at such times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had crossed the stable-yard and gone into the
field beyond, to get clearer sight of the wild-geese;
and when the last of them had hurried by, she looked
about her. There were signs in plenty of the storm
to come. Just as the brindled cat had sought the
fender, sheep were hurrying to cover of the wall.
Rooks, feeding tranquilly an hour since in upland
oat-stubble, sped homeward. In the high thorn-edge,
storm-cocks, that love a tilt at harsh weather,
cried lustily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca looked far down the field, and saw a speck
move up it. The speck took man’s shape by and
by. A scud of snow was following him up the hill,
and by his shammocky stride she was sure he hailed
from Garsykes. This puzzled her. An attack in
force on Logie she could have understood, but it
was not like the Wilderness Folk for one of them to
come alone into a hostile country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snow-scud overtook and hid him for awhile.
Then again she saw him plodding up, and she could
distinguish now a bulky sack that swayed about his
shoulders. With a grim face, and a grimmer heart,
Rebecca waited. Jonah the cat, hugging the fire
indoors, had claws to show in time of need. So
had she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gale was up in earnest, and snow thickened
fast about the man who hurried up the field. Soon
he began to blunder this way and that through the
blinding maze, and a sharp, bitter cry rang up-wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn Nita Langrish. She sent me into this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca laughed with eerie gentleness. The man
came from Garsykes, as she had guessed, and Nita
had sent him on an errand. Already he was hidden
by the on-driving wall of snow, and so much for him.
The wild-geese had flighted to-day, and Logie’s luck
was in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So intent the woman was on nursing vengeance
that the storm was on her, too, before she found a
thought for her own safety. Though scarcely twenty
yards from the gate that led into the stable-yard,
it took long to find it; and afterwards, close to her
own kitchen, wind and snow played blind-man’s-buff
with her before she found the door, and opened it,
and had to use all her lean, hard strength to close
it against the in-leaping storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jonah still slept tranquilly inside the fender, dreaming
of rats to be hunted in the stables when good
weather came again. Rebecca’s glance rested on
him, lying plump and sleek there, and wrath descended
on her. She snatched a besom up, and gave him the
thick end of it with zest, as she had promised not
long since in idle banter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I give to vagabones,” she said, and
thwacked him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jonah sprang to the top of the big chair beside the
hearth, and spat at her. His fur was stiff, like an
angry dog’s, and he swept down a wild-cat’s paw
at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting to be your own man again?” said
Rebecca. “Well, it’s time you did, now the rats
creep up from Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she took up her rolling-pin and went
on with the pastry-making as quietly as if nothing
had disturbed the work; but her thoughts were with
the man she had watched creeping up the field. A
glance at the window showed panes crusting ever
thicker as the snow drove at them, and a hard smile
played about her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brindled cat eyed her with wrath that cooled
by slow degrees. He washed himself all over, as
if to clear away the besom’s touch, and stood on
the chair-top in sullen dignity. Then suddenly he
jumped to the floor and up to Rebecca’s shoulder at
a bound. They could never quarrel for long, these two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your cantrips again,” said Rebecca calmly,
“as if you were kitten-high—and resting all your
great, idle weight on a woman that won’t put up with
such-like nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cat stayed where he was, and presently Rebecca
began to talk to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a Garsykes Man out yonder, Jonah. It
must be cold lying. He’ll never taste kitchen-warmth
again, or the crisp of an apple-pasty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jonah purred against her withered cheek, and
watched the rolling-pin go up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see him now as he came up the pasture.
The snow overtook him, and he wambled like a
drunken man, and dropped. There’ll be his burial-mound
above him—a biggish mound by this time.
So there’s another of the foul brood gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From within-doors—loud as the wind was screaming
at the windows—Rebecca heard a fretful cry steal
down the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the pedlar,” she grumbled. “Good sakes.
I’d forgotten he was all on his lonesome—his legs
forsaking him, and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was striving pitifully to rise when she
reached the long-settle. “Where’s Causleen?” he
pleaded. “I feel an old, old man, buried out of
sight, when she’s not near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca wondered, too, where Causleen was. The
Master was out in the storm, but he knew every
barn and bield-wall of his country, and would find
shelter somehow. Causleen was a stranger. It might
be that she had met the same white death that the
Garsykes Man had found. And she had sent her
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’ll be here by and by,” she said, pity stirring
at her gnarled old heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald’s glance wandered to the pike that had
gone to Flodden Field and back, and again he tried
to rise. “There was so much I had to tell her.
You’re kind, and bid us stay at Logie—but there’s
rust of Jaimie the King’s blood up there. I cannot
eat or sleep within the house. Causleen knows I
cannot—and she will not come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m tucking the blankets round you,” said
Rebecca, her hands deft and gentle, “and I’m telling
you to get to sleep, or give me a reason t’ other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald yielded to the warmth and rest; and in
his dozing his heart leaped into his lips, and he told
in few, poignant words what the years behind had
meant to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The long, grey roads—the footsore roads—selling
Pedlar’s Balsam to other folk—it’s a weary life.
There’s no time for the pedlar to balsam his own
feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so they watched beside him through the night,
Rebecca and the brindled cat. From time to time
the woman crossed to the window, to see if there were
any sign of the storm’s abating. There was none,
and her fears for Causleen increased. Yet she could
do nothing, and fell asleep at last in the chair drawn
up beside the settle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was up when she awoke. A glance at
Donald showed him lying in childlike slumber, with
Jonah curled up on the blankets; and Rebecca went
out into the sunlight, scanning the lower slopes in
search of the Master or Causleen. They did not
come, though the thaw had opened out wide tracks
of green between the drifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her long time at Logie, Rebecca had never known
a tempest so quick to come and go. A wind swift
and bitter from the east had driven her indoors last
night. Now a warm, playful breeze played against
her face. The gold and crimson glory of the autumn
woods reared itself above great scuds of snow that
melted almost as they fell. And everywhere there
was the cry of waters, big and little; for every dingle
of the pastures was a running beck, and all the glens
were rivers, bank-top high with snow-broth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca heard the rooks come clamouring to their
sycamores and ancient nests—heard a throstle pipe
a stave or two, as if he scented spring after this wild
October night—and knew then that the storm would
not return for many days. Rooks and the thrushes
were old in weather-lore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the Master did not come, nor Causleen, and
Rebecca wondered if the Gabble-Ratchet had brought
luck to Logie, after all. The pedlar’s girl meant
little to her, but if Hardcastle was dead—if never
again she would sew buttons on for him, or cook
his meals, or bear with his gusty temper—it was
near her time to be done with this world and its
foolishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca glanced downhill again, and when still
no sign of life showed between the brimming waters,
her thoughts turned to the man from Garsykes who
had been overtaken by the storm last night. She
crossed the stable-yard and went down the field
on the far side of it till she reached a pile of melting
snow. Out of the mound showed a man’s two hands,
limp and glistening-wet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No spark of pity or horror touched Rebecca. With
fierce, exultant patience she watched the snow-shroud
crumble, till now his arms showed to the sunlight,
then his lean neck with the mouldy kerchief tied
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sun and south wind between them were busy with
the melting, and presently the man’s face showed.
It had been a coarse face, lined with slyness; but
snow and death had washed it, and it carried a strange
look of peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sack he had carried lay beside him. She
opened it, and knew at last the object of his journey.
It was filled with pine-logs, twigs and resin. These
and the tinder-box in his pocket were enough to set
Logie flaming from end to end of its grey gables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dead man could tell her nothing now; but
he had told all yesterday when, baffled by the storm,
he cursed Nita Langrish for bringing him into this.
Rebecca pieced the tale together with shrewd vision.
There was none from this to Langstrothdale who
garnered news like Nita the basket-weaver. Men
passed her as she sat on the bridge-wall, her fingers
slender almost as the withies she plaited. They
stayed for gossip with a maid known through the
Dale to be a maddener of men, and she ’ticed their
news from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita had learned, no doubt, that the Master was
from home, and had sent up this poor, dead fool
to fire the house. Rebecca stirred the body with her
foot, in grudging pity. Then the peace in his face—the
still unalterable peace—brought wrath and
brimstone round her once again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve found too soft an end,” she grumbled—“too
soft by half, my lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still standing there, the feud raw at her
heart, when Causleen and the Master came up together
from their vigil in the foresters’ hut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re safe, then, the pair of you,” she said.
“I was fearing for the pedlar’s girl. She’s not used
to our rough country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen was ashamed of her own shame, as she
heard Hardcastle tell how he had met her just in time—heard
Rebecca’s blunt thankfulness that they had
found a hut to spend the night in, safe from the worst
blizzard ever known on Logie-side. Why had her
pride taken fire because Hardcastle had saved her
life? Why had she stooped to think of gossip and
dishonour, when these two saw the past night as
a fight against weather—a fight won by Logie?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Causleen saw the muddled heap that yesterday
had been a man—saw the wet face and hands,
the pitiful, threadbare clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One from Garsykes that’s dead,” said Rebecca
tranquilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor pedlar. What does he carry in that big
pack of his?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough to burn Logie down from roof to cellar.
But he’s dead. And the Master’s quick. It’s Logie’s
turn this time.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap11'>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<h3>VENOM</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Nita Langrish, later in the day of Hardcastle’s
home-coming with the pedlar’s girl, took her
way up to Logie between the melting drifts.
Straight and slim she went, and an old tinker who met
her on the road stood and gaped at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Begosh, I wish I was younger,” he chuckled. “I’d
go a-courting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita laughed at him, as if her heart were light as his,
and turned once—in vanity—to be sure that he was
watching her go down the hill. Then she thought of
Hardcastle, of what she had heard just now in Garsykes;
and an evil mood got into her blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came to Logie Brigg and looked down at Wharfe
River, swirling in high flood between the slender arches.
Half-frozen packs of snow were riding here and there
above the peat-brown waves. Under her feet the
fierce waters roared and sang their Viking call of kill and
spare not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all in tune with her heart, as she climbed the
steep rise to Logie. The trees were so thick about the
house that she could not see yet whether its walls gaped
wide and blackened. The man she had sent to fire it
had not returned with news. He had perished in the
storm likely—after he’d done his work, she hoped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she topped the rise, and came to Logie’s
gate, blue wood-smoke was curling up from peaceful
chimneys, and Rebecca stood there talking with Brant
the shepherd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a friend of yours in the Long Pasture
yonder.” Rebecca’s voice was grimly bantering.
“The snow has cleaned his face for him, but I’d have
known he came from Garsykes all the same. It
couldn’t take the rabbity smell o’ the man away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again a little wind of dread stirred at Nita’s heart,
as it had chilled her when Long Murgatroyd had spoken
of death for one or other of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What friend of mine should be in any Logie field?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, deny your own. It’s like you, Nita. Won’t
you go and have a look at the man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not much to look at, I own—but he died
running an errand of yours. He sent a queer sort of
cry up when the snow took him—cursed Nita Langrish
for sending him to Logie—so that you must have heard
it out to Garsykes, I’d have fancied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita faced her ancient adversary with cool devilry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry he died before he fired Logie. He was
always a fool, and clumsy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dare own to it?” snapped Rebecca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl was uncanny in her self-assurance, her eager
beauty. “Yes,” she said. “What has Nita the basket-weaver
to fear, when all the men go daft about her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca reached a lean hand out across the gate—swift
as Jonah the cat might have flicked a paw—but
Nita was too quick for her. She drew back from
all life’s onsets, with soft, elusive speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the men but one,” laughed Nita, from the
middle of the roadway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, all but the Master. You’ll never fool him
twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pedlar’s brat is doing that for me. Have they
come home, the pair of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have, thanks be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Thanks be?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca answered the girl’s scorn with tart assurance.
“Why, yes. I sent that bairn of the pedlar’s
out to get a breath o’ fresh air—the dear knows she
needed it—and it would have lain on my conscience if
she’d foundered in the snow. The Master happened
on her, luckily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garsykes has learned as much. From all we hear,
they made themselves snug enough for the night—blessed
the snow for coming, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil knotted thy whipcord of a tongue, Nita,
but its lash doesn’t hurt us Logie Folk. We keep clean
houses hereabout—and cleanish minds. What else was
to be done, save shelter from such an audacious storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they sheltered to some purpose. Murgatroyd
saw them sitting by the hearth—she on his knee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve known Murgatroyd all his life,” broke in
Rebecca, “and all his life he never spoke a true word
unless he fell into it by accident. Get ye back to
Garsykes, and feed your pigs on such-like trash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shepherd Brant had been tugging at his beard,
wroth kindling slowly till its fire was bright and steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s another man o’ Logie doesn’t heed your
snares, Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re old, shepherd. I’d mistake you for a grey
rock if I didn’t see you move from time to time. Have
you shot Storm the sheep-slayer yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. When I do, it’s a sign that Garsykes
ends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then once again some little breeze of fear played
about Nita, but she would not heed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gypsy woman came to our village, Brant, not so
long since. She had the Sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aye,” growled the shepherd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She told us of Hardcastle and his fight against
Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gleaned that sort o’ news from any man or child
about the country-side. I’m acquainted with all the
tricks of Romany—especially sheep-stealing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She said an ancient shepherd was seeking a dog
named Storm, to kill him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the shepherd would do his best to ruin Logie,
by killing Logie’s luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She lied, like all the Romaneys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you what she told me, shepherd,” said Nita,
her grey eyes quiet and candid. “And I told the
gypsy woman that Garsykes would see to Logie’s ruin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to go down the road again and halted
with fearless insolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I’m selling my baskets up dale and down—how
they’ll laugh at the tale of how they shared the
hut together—Hardcastle and she.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she went her way, singing the little eerie
ballad she had sung to Widow Mathison’s boy when
Hardcastle met her in the road not long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca watched her go, and all her strength to
endure grew tough and sinewy. They were few and
lonely, here at Logie, now the feud was up; and Nita
Langrish was a dismaying power about the land, with
her beauty that put men in leading strings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s meant for Logie’s funeral song,” she muttered,
as they watched the retreating figure. “Well,
shepherd, we’re neither killed nor buried yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita, half down the steep bend of the road that led
to Logie Brigg, saw Causleen come through the wicket-gate
and out into the highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looking for the Master?” she asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen knew little of the basket-weaver, except
that she was an old love of Hardcastle’s, and read no
guile in the question, in the innocent, soft eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He has ridden for the doctor. My father
is—is worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as well, maybe.” Nita’s jealousy noted the
quiver in the other’s voice, but did not spare her sorrow.
“He may never need hear about the woodmen’s hut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen stood very still for a moment, looking at
Nita Langrish. The blow was so sudden, the pain of it
so like a knife-thrust driven home, that she was dizzy and
bewildered. Then the quick, Highland fire leaped to her
face, showing a wild beauty that angered Nita all afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows and understands,” she said—“<span class='it'>as you
could not</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that was said and left unsaid in those few words
stung Nita like a lash. This peddling castaway could
hold her own, and more than her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe not. But I can set the whole Dale rocking
with the tale Long Murgatroyd brought home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she laughed in Causleen’s face and went
her way. Half down the road, where it wound sheer
and stark to Logie Brigg, she met Hardcastle, urging a
hard-driven horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your light o’ love is waiting for you,” she said,
curtseying in sheer mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One in a lifetime is enough for me, Nita,” he
answered grimly, and rode on. He and his horse had
travelled many a hilly mile in pursuit of a hard-worked
doctor, and had not found him; and he was sorry,
because Causleen was tired enough already, after last
night’s storm, without this added trouble of the father
who was near to death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came in sight of the wicket-gate, and slipped
from saddle, and let his horse find its own way to stable.
Causleen was at the gate, her back turned to the roadway,
and Hardcastle was afraid, somehow, to listen to
the girl’s wild sobbing. It startled and unmanned him.
He longed to get away, yet could not leave her in this
plight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done my best to find the doctor,” he said,
putting a kindly hand on her shoulder, “but he’s away
up Amerdale. Is Donald worse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew away, as if his touch scorched her. “He
is better—just for awhile—and I ran out to see if you
had brought the doctor. And a woman came instead—so
pretty, and with so foul a tongue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle remembered Nita’s mocking curtsey—recalled
Long Murgatroyd’s intrusion into the foresters’
hut last night—and the riddle of it all grew plain.
Nita’s tongue had been busy with the pedlar’s girl and
he knew what it could do even to rough men. Something
stirred at his heart—the heart frozen long since,
so that it had forgotten how to suffer, joy or grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody cares what Nita says. She says, and goes
on saying—and folk laugh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Folk often laugh, when they should cry
instead. It is not your fault that we had to shelter
from the storm—yet how I loathe you for it, Hardcastle
of Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was on fire with pride, with contempt of Nita
Langrish and her power to wound. And, dimly as yet,
Hardcastle understood her passion. “What else was
there to do but shelter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing; but that does not help us. It was not
your fault that we came to your gate, father and I, and
became your pensioners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My guests,” said Hardcastle, with gruff kindliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Threadbare guests, forced on you. And what can I
do, with father as he is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen remembered Nita’s words, her laughter as
she went down the road; and the poison festered, as if
a snake had bitten her. How could she stay on, with
all the country-side passing Nita’s gossip to and fro?
How could she leave, while her father lay between life
and death, babbling of far Inverness and pipes that
skirled about the moorland glens?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thank and loathe you,” she said, and left him
there—muddled, not for the first time in his life, by the
ways of a maid with a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle watched her till she was hidden by a
shower of red, fast-falling leaves. He was impatient of
some feeling that the girl had roused, some stirring at
the heart he had hardened against intrusion. The
Wilderness had put a slight on her, as it had striven to
slight Logie. She was going in fear of the open, as he
went sometimes where there was nothing doing and he
had leisure to remember how strong and merciless was
the hornets’ nest he had roused at Garsykes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly he understood the bond between
them. She was proud and weary. So was he.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap12'>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<h3>THE SHEEP-SLAYER</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>For a week the days went at Logie as if Garsykes
had no feud with it. That was the way of the
Wilderness Folk, and the nameless dreads that
came at such waiting times began to patter up and
down the house. Storm, after staying for a night and
a day, had heard the wolf-call once again, and was gone.
The Master rode much abroad, and would tire two
horses out between dawn and gloaming. That was his
way of stifling suspense. Rebecca’s was to quarrel
with the brindled cat who was her shadow and
familiar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald was neither better nor worse, though both by
turns; and Causleen, whenever she met Hardcastle,
baffled him by her chill aloofness. It seemed to him
that she would rather have died in the snow than owe
her life to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the end of the week, Brant the shepherd came
at nightfall, and knocked at the kitchen door, and came
stamping in, a gun under his arm and quiet good
humour in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Draw me a mug of ale, Rebecca,” he said, “for
I’ve earned it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, all men fancy that, at any hour o’ day or night.
What have you done, Stephen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve shot Storm at last. A son of Belial, I call him,
and he skulked to the last—got away into the brackens,
but his hind legs were trailing. I’d like to have found
his carcase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something hidden in Rebecca leaped into fury:
Storm was dear to her, as to Hardcastle, whatever his
backslidings. Jonah and he had been comrades in old
days, the cat sitting on his back and playing pranks
with him. She had fed him by stealth, when the
Master brought him home to the cupboard under the
stair, had rated him for the life he was leading these
days—finishing with a “there, you can’t help it, like,
and get sleep and victuals while you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no ale for you to-night, Stephen,” she said,
gaunt and truculent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why, if I might ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you come boasting you’ve shot the dog
that saved you all at Garsykes. There were few of
Logie’s Men, and many of theirs; and he scattered
them for you, to some purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, woman, he kills sheep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And saves men, it seems. The Master mightn’t be
here—or you either—if it hadn’t been for Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shepherd was nonplussed for a moment.
“That’s true enough,” he muttered, plucking at his
thin, wiry beard. “They were in a mind to kill us that
day, with their women egging them on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you come here, snug as a toad in its hole, and
tell me you’ve killed Storm. A queer way of showing
thankfulness for what life there’s left in your old
bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t understand. You never could, not
being a shepherd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without a heart in his body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With a heart for ravished ewes. There’s a law
among us, fixed as old Pengables. A dog turned wolf
is hunted till he’s shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s a law in my kitchen, too. No ale for
the man that murdered Storm. I was talking to Jonah
here about the uses of a besom when you stepped in—but
I’m minded to thwack you instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m fairish dry, Rebecca,” said the shepherd, with
sudden wistfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope as much. The drier you get, the better I’ll
like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood at bay, regarding each other with dour
enmity, till Rebecca thought of Hardcastle, riding home
from Norbrigg market and late to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Garsykes sort lie quiet,” she said, “and it’s
getting hard to bear. I wish the Master would listen
to sense, and not go taking his journeys as if naught
had happened at the pinfold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s made that way. An earthquake wouldn’t
alter him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Obstinate, like his father before him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rare plucked ’un, like his father. After all, if
he’s got to be killed, he’s wise to seek it in the open.
When my time comes, says I, give me God’s sky to
turn my toes to, and curlews singing me to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that’s all nonsense, Brant. You live too
lonely on the heights yonder, and your fancies breed
like maggots. When my time comes, give me a cosy
hearth and the taste of a treacle-posset in my throat.
That’s how I’d say my last good-bye to Logie. And
here we stand chattering, while the Master lies murdered,
like Storm, somewhere ’twixt here and Norbrigg.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, now, you’re running to meet trouble before it
comes. And as for Storm, he wasn’t murdered, I’d
have you know. Justice was what he got, and if I’d my
way, they’d tar such-like and hang ’em in chains at the
cross-roads, same as human footpads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hold your whisht, Stephen. Cannot you see
that I’m sick with wondering why the Master’s late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So will the pedlar’s girl be, if all they say be true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When all they say is true, all the geese in the world
will be dead—not one of ’em left to cackle. I was out
in that blizzard, and ran fairish quick for shelter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So did I, and was near over-blown at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so did Master and Donald’s girl. They were
prisoned for the night; but it’s only Garsykes way they
think worse of them for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant fidgetted about the kitchen, warming himself
at the fire one moment, then going to the door as if he
listened for some cry of trouble out of doors. “I’m
not easy in mind myself,” he said at last. “Maybe
I’ll step out Norbrigg way and see what’s happening
to him. This gun of mine may come in useful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the man I thought you,” snapped Rebecca.
“Bide till you’ve had a pull at the ale, then get your
best foot forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle himself, an hour before, had ridden up
from Norbrigg through the dusk that showed no more
than a glimpse of the track ahead. It was only when
he came through Weathersett village, perched high on
top of the rise, that he rode into keen frosty moonlight.
His glance roved over the broken lands, the grey roads
that wound across them. The waiting time at Logie,
for what Garsykes spite could do to him, seemed far-off.
He was not between house-walls now, but in the
open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tang of the frosty wind, smell of the uplands, got
into his blood. He plucked his horse to a canter, then
checked him as they went by the pinfold where he had
answered three men’s call for tribute. Again he looked
out across the moonlit wastes, and down at the hollow
where Garsykes village lurked. If the Lost Folk
needed him, he was here, and glad of any onset after the
quiet of these last days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No onset came. The moonlight showed him only a
grey-blue land of sleeping pastures, a glint of white
where snow-drifts, still unmelted, hugged the walls.
He felt thwarted of his due, somehow, and it seemed
hard to get safe home again and wait for whatever
devilry Garsykes had in mind. Then his mind yielded
to the night’s persuasion as his horse trotted forward
soberly between the heather and the pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moist, wayward spurts of wind rustled the fallen
leaves. The undergrowth was stealthy with the feet
of things that fled, of bigger things that hunted. A
night-jar cried harshly in the thickest of the wood.
From the slopes beyond came the rough call of a buck
to his mate, telling her to get behind him while he met
some peril threatening both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The streams had their own eerie music, too. Fed
by swift-melting snow, they sobbed and crooned and
wailed as they raced to Wharfe River far below. And
the wind would not be still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle rode through the haunted land with a
song at his heart, such as nothing brought to him these
days except night-time on the Logie roads. They said
he would never marry, and he knew they said it. They
lied, as usual, for he had wived these grim and tender
lands handed down to him by generations whose voices
lived about the house of Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dusk of the forest kept him company till he rode
into the open, and saw the free, spacious road wind up
to Logie under the scudding moonlight. It was good
to be alive, with such a heritage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly his horse blundered. Before he had
time to try to break his fall, he was thrown across the
road and into the dark hollow bordering the wood.
One half of him lay soft and wet; the other jarred on
something lean and bony—something that rapped out
stifled curses, and turned under him with writhing
fury, and strove to get a grip about his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fought together in the hollow, he and his
unseen adversary, till their hands grew slippery with
mud and it was hard to get any sort of hold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Garsykes, you?” gasped Hardcastle, feeling
for the grip that should settle all. “Swine love the
ditches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer came. His enemy was striving, too, for
the strangle-hold that constantly eluded him. The
stealthy fight went on. The whole world was narrowed
to this dark corner by the roadway, and the slime sucked
and gurgled under the weight of their striving bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hardcastle found his chance, and took it. He
got one arm under the man’s thighs, the other round
his shoulders, lifted him with savage strength, and
pitched him clear into the roadway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he clambered after him, the moonlight, clear
and blue, showed him a lank figure getting up from the
wet, grey road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it’s you, Long Murgatroyd,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, it’s me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be damned to you, why did you hide in a muddy
ditch if you wanted another fight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd, white-faced and spent, glanced at the
rope swinging gently across the road, and the Master
saw it for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve come as low as that?” The Master was
shaken by passionate loathing. “As low as that,
Murgatroyd?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, your blamed luck won’t last for ever. Any
but you would have been pitched on his head when his
horse got into the rope—and I’d have finished you,
need being. So now your going to finish me instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle’s riding-whip was lifted to cut the man
across the face; but Murgatroyd was laughing at him
in the moonlight—a wan laugh enough, yet full of
dogged will to endure whatever came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita sent you on the errand?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She did, in a way. We know what her tongue is—me
and you, we know it. She said you were my master
any day if it came to a fight. So I stepped up to kill
you.” Again he laughed. “I should have told her
naught of the rope, you understand. There’d have
been you ligging dead in the road, and happen she’d
have given me a kiss or two for my pains. That’s how
it was. And I’m here, and want to be rid o’ my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle could make nothing of it. Wrath died
in him. The man was rough as a savage, simple
beyond belief. He had come up to kill, and, failing,
expected no mercy from his enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, damn you all ways, Murgatroyd,” he said, and
went to where his horse stood trembling, and felt its
knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd looked on, with dazed wonder.
“Broken are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sound as a bell,” growled Hardcastle, as he swung
into the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd watched him out of sight. The
Master of Logie was a fool, no doubt, to leave him ripe
for further mischief; but in some queer way he
found a liking for him. He dealt fair with all
about the country-side; and fairness appealed to
this chastened mood of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only Nita would let him alone, he’d rather see
Hardcastle live than die. <span class='it'>If only Nita would let him
alone.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words got into his muddled wits as he looked
from the forest to the misty fells where Garsykes slept
in the flooding moonlight. Some uncouth purpose
stirred him. He went and unfastened the rope he had
tied from tree to tree across the road. The knots were
tight and his fingers clumsy; but at last he coiled it into
a neat bundle, climbed the wall on his right, and lopped
like a hare down the grey-blue pastures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he neared the little brig that crossed Crooning
Water, a clear, sweet voice drifted up the breeze, singing
a song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd halted, swayed between longing and
loathing. Then murder got into his heart again, as he
turned the bend of the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita Langrish was sitting on the bridge-wall, threading
her willows in and out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Making baskets by moonlight?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finishing one for a lass up Dale that’s courting.
So it’s only right to weave moonshine in between the
withers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re courting, Nita, you and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It takes two for that,” she said, and went on with
her work as if she were alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great madness came on Murgatroyd. She sat
there in the moonlight so mocking and aloof, yet so
enticing, that the helpless rage of years found tongue.
He cursed the day she came into Garsykes first, cursed
every meeting with her since, till his hoarse voice
seemed like a flail about her. For a moment Nita was
afraid—of him, and of the stark truth he spoke. Then
she gathered her old dominion round her, her old self-will
and vanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been at the drinking again,” she said, with
gentle insolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have—drinking the dregs, like many another
that’s come your way. You draw your skirts away
fro’ Widow Mathison at the inn, same as if she was dirt.
But she’s got what you’ve not—a heart in her feckless
body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita had finished her basket and stood, slim and
straight, looking into the man’s face with grey, childlike
eyes as she waited for what he had to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has a lad of her own—dotes on him, and naught
too much to do, mending and fending for him. <span class='it'>You</span>
dote on yourself, Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s voice had grown quiet, and Nita thought
his madness ended, till he took the rope from under his
arm and began to uncoil it with a leisurely sort of haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure,” she said, “Garsykes will be smoked out
soon, like a hornet’s nest. Time was when it bred men,
not windle-straws. And you’re for trying how the
noose will feel about your neck—when Logie gets
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Murgatroyd, “I’m for fitting it about
yours, Nita, and hanging you to a branch of yond big
sycamore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw now the steady light of madness in his eyes,
the purpose sure and downright. Fear unsteadied her
again, but she remembered bygone years of blandishment.
She came to him, and laid a hand on his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could you hurt me? I’m such a little thing, and
you’re so big. You couldn’t hurt me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, but I could.” The man’s voice was low and
harsh as he put her away from him and fingered the
rope with restless fingers. “I could hurt you to some
purpose. Sometimes I fancy there’s naught I want any
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put both hands on his shoulders now. Her lips
were close to his, and her breath was warm and soft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naught else?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old, daft longing stole about him. Little, baffling
webs were spun across his sullen will to make an
end of Nita and her devilries. He reached out his arms
to gather her to him—but she had stepped back and
stood smiling at him in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, maybe, or the next day after,” she
said—“when you’ve forgotten about ropes and
sycamores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her go. He was too heartsick even to
curse her, or to follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s always to-morrow with her,” he muttered,
shivering in the breeze that whimpered down from
Drumly Ghyll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he leaned over the bridge, listening to the
stream as it swirled in the deep pool below. The water
called him. Every sob and gurgle enticed him to a
death found easily. The plunge would be cold, into
broth of melted snow, but after that—well, they said
it was a quiet way of going out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet he could not take the plunge. For ever Nita’s
voice was in his ear, with its promise of “to-morrow,
maybe.” She drew him from the waters. It was a
lying promise, but she drew him. Reluctantly he
turned his face towards Garsykes, and down the fell
Nita’s song came with the breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd recalled the Master’s farewell to him
awhile since. Hardcastle’s words had a way of sticking,
he’d noticed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn you all ways, Nita Langrish,” he said,
and laughed heavily, and took the field-track up to
Garsykes.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle rode slowly home to Logie, after his
encounter in the wayside ditch. For a week he had
been restless, wondering what Garsykes meant to do
with him. Now they had shot their bolt, and he survived.
Never in his life had he known this keen, hard
joy that was growing with the feud. Once they had
tried to take him at the pinfold—and once a man had
come to fire his house and been over-blown by snow.
Now they had stretched a rope across the road to hinder
him, and he was up in saddle again. Whatever the
future had in store, he had given no tribute to Garsykes,
and would give none.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a bend of the road he met Shepherd Brant, who
greeted him with taciturn relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s better to be quick than dead, Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, Stephen,” said Hardcastle, answering dryness
with dryness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rebecca was in such a rare taking about you—thinking
you were murdered on the Norbrigg road—that
I set off in search. Has it been raining in those
parts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raining? No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wondered, seeing you dripping-wet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was one from Garsykes in a ditch, and I had
to get him out of it—by the scruff of his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Brant, lighting his pipe. “And which
of ’em was he like to look at, if I might ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was very like Long Murgatroyd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you maimed him for life, and so put him out
o’ harm’s way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The last I saw of him, he was standing like a dazed
fool in the roadway—too soft for a man to hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was like you, Master,” growled Brant, and
touched his cap with chill respect as he turned for home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle only laughed as he rode forward. He
knew Brant as he knew himself. If Stephen had seen
Long Murgatroyd in the roadway, grey-faced and
quavering, the shepherd would have understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came by High Ghyll Wood, with the merry
breeze in their faces, and the Master’s horse was thinking
only of oats in the near-by stable when he halted in
his stride and shied at nothing, so far as Hardcastle
could tell. His head was turned toward the wood, and
a shiver ran down his sturdy flanks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hardcastle drew rein, and listened. There
might be another ambush waiting for him before he
got to Logie. A horse had quicker hearing than a man.
And now he heard a far-off crying in the wood—the
yelping cry of a beast in pain—and thought a fox had
got into one of the foresters’ many traps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he listened, he knew it was no fox in trouble, but
a dog; and he had a soft heart for all that breed.
Riding forward till he came to the gate near ahead, he
tethered his horse to the trunk of a gnarled thorn-bush,
and plunged into the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yelping cries were mingled now with fierce,
tortured howls that guided him, step by step, to a clump
of brackens where something lay and writhed, beating
down the shelter it had sought in need. The moon
shone clear through the leafless branches of the silver-birches
overhead—shone on a dog’s bloodshot eyes and
hairy face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Storm, what ails you?” asked Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment the sheep-slayer knew him and strove
to wriggle to his hand; then his wounds were rawed
again by the wind. He yelped and growled by turns
when Hardcastle approached and felt down his body
to find what limbs were broken; and suddenly a madness
seized him. He bit at the hands that touched his
wounds. All of him that was unmaimed was quick for
attack. Hardcastle, to him, was Shepherd Brant, who
had pursued him with a hate that would not let him
rest—Brant, who had put gunshot into him at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had found the second ambush, after all,
and one hard to meet. He strove with Storm, his
hands bitten to the bone. This sheep-killer had come
in time of need, when he scattered the Garsykes Men
awhile since. There was a big debt owing by the
house of Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Storm’s strength was spent. He let the Master
shoulder him, a dead-weight of weariness, and carry
him to the horse tethered to the thorn-tree. The horse
neighed and fidgetted as Hardcastle lifted Storm to
the saddle, and held him there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up to Logie,” he said. “There are all jobs in
a day, even for a thoroughbred.”</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, wandering restlessly about Logie House,
heard Shepherd Brant come into the kitchen with news
that he had shot Storm at last. She heard, too,
Rebecca’s talk of danger to the Master on his way from
Norbrigg; and her restlessness increased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm had found no more than his due, perhaps;
but she had made a comrade of the shaggy culprit, and
it seemed a cruel death for any dog. So little friendship
came her way. She would miss his stealthy coming to
the cupboard under the stair, her own stealthy journeys
to the larder in search of a bone for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, struggle with the feeling as she might, she
began to share Rebecca’s fears for Hardcastle. Suppose,
in sober fact, he was lying somewhere on the
Norbrigg road? Suppose his big, hale body would
never ride the hill-crests again, or taste the savour of
keen moorland weather? She felt the pity of it, and
with pity came remembrance of the tempest they had
shared. But for him, she would have died in the snow.
That would have mattered little, for herself; to her
father it would have meant an end of the last consolation
left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedlar was calling her now. His eyes were
bright and eager when she knelt beside him and took his
cold hands into hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m seeing all the Highlands, child—not just Ben
Crummock here, or Ben Ore there—but the good, wild
sweep o’ them all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice was clear again, vibrant and youthful as
when he went a-Maying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as if I was standing on a high mountain—seeing
it all spread out below me—hearing the pipes
sob up from Glencoe, and over Culloden Muir, and out
from the Western Isles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never heed their sobbing,” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will, for it heartens me. Where I stand now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tremor shook him, a dry, harsh coughing; but he
was so nearly rid of his body that his high spirit stormed
and conquered it afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where I stand now the after-music sounds. The
pipers come, leading our Highland dead—there’s still
a plaining and a sorrow, but the strathspey sounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through blinding tears Causleen saw this courageous
father, stalwart to the end, his vision clear as a boy’s,
his faith indomitable. She was losing him, and soon.
Whenever one of her race neared the threshold of
beyond, the pipers summoned them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They sorrowed here. They’ll come by and by into
all they fought for in the narrow glens, and up the braes—cannot
you see them, girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedlar strove to rise, because his vision was so
urgent, and fell back, and moaned awhile in helplessness.
Then he glanced at Causleen with quiet humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Standing on a high hill, was I?” he muttered.
“It was a good dream while it lasted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then his eyes clouded, and he slept; and Causleen,
roaming the winding passages again, encountered
Rebecca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll only come the one way home to Logie,”
muttered the woman. “He’ll only come the one way
now—stretched on a gate, with four men carrying him.
It was so they brought my man home, forty odd years
since, after <span class='it'>he</span> had said nay to the Garsykes sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, awed by the loneliness of corridors and
stairs that seemed peopled with ghosts, followed
Rebecca as she went to the door, and opened it, and
stood listening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All’s quiet as yet,” said Rebecca, turning by and
by; “but it’ll not be quiet for long. It’s a queer sort
o’ shuffling noise they make—four men carrying a gate
and something heavy stretched on it. Forty years
since I heard it last! It seems like yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl yielded to the other’s hard, quiet certainty
that Hardcastle was dead—yielded to the wind’s
sobbing in among the half-stripped branches of the
sycamores outside. Again pity touched her—a deeper
pity now. If the Master’s welcome at their first
coming had been chilly, he had bettered it with every
day that followed. She and her father had been
nothing but a burden to him from the start, yet he had
made them guests of honour in his own gruff fashion.
There was the night, too, at the woodmen’s hut. She
had railed at him for saving her; but now she understood.
And it was too late.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca’s lean body grew intent on the sudden. She
stepped out into the moonlight, and presently Causleen
heard, too, the pit-a-pat of hoofs sound up the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re bringing him on horseback, instead of a
gate,” said Rebecca, in the same hard, quiet tone;
“but it’s a dead man rides, and that I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen could think no less. The slow clink of
hoofs suggested no living master, riding home to his
own roof-tree and its cheer. Somewhere—in her heart
or mind, she knew not which—there was a sense of
bitter loss. Already, without guessing it, she had
grown to lean on Hardcastle in these days of grief and
home-sickness for the Highlands. And he was gone,
all but the husk of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hoof-beats sounded nearer now, and Rebecca’s
stillness broke like thunder-weather. Forty years was
cancelled. It was her own man coming, so she fancied.
In a flash she went through the anguish of that far-off
time—the dead lips making no answer to her kisses,
the limp arms that would never again shield her from
life’s tumults.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dashed the tears away with a rough, skinny
hand, and saw Causleen there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not your fault, or the pedlar’s,” she snapped,
old days and new mingling, with no gap between them—“but
how dare he unfasten his pack and show me
baby-wear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, young but tried by many footsore journeys,
had learned insight into such moods as this. She
understood the other’s wild clinging to past grief, as to
a better thing than present joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did not know,” she pleaded softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To be sure. He didn’t know. But he might as
well have put a skewer through my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Rebecca forgot the girl. Standing straight to
her lean height, she reached out her arms, and stood
there calling to the man killed long since by the Lost
Folk. She bade him come quickly, for she had wakened
from a dream that he was dead—bade him step up and
tarry no more—pretended he was here beside her, and
closed her arms about the emptiness, crooning a girl’s
love-welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slow pit-a-pat of hoofs had rounded the corner
now, and Rebecca woke as from a trance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get indoors, lass,” she said. “Dead men are no
good sight for young eyes to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen answered nothing. She waited, sick with
fear. Step by step the horse brought its burden
nearer. There was no pride in her heart now, no
memory of Hardcastle’s curt welcome—was it a few
weeks ago, or years? She did not know—knew only
that she would miss something that had come into her
life to stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pity of it—oh, the pity,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather he died that fashion,” snapped Rebecca,
peering out into the moonlight, “than in a bed he’d
bought by giving tribute Garsykes way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would not go to meet trouble, and Causleen dared
not. So Hardcastle came leading his horse to the door,
and was astonished to find two women there who gazed
at him as if he came from under some tomb in the
churchyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it your ghost, Master?” quavered Rebecca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s my body—and damned tired at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, before she could check the impulse, ran
forward and touched his sleeve. Long watching
beside her father had weakened her endurance. So
had the suspense that brooded over Logie since the
feud was up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank God,” she said with a sudden rush of tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glanced at her in frank wonder. It was
long since anyone had given him such a welcome home;
yet only yesterday she had shunned him as if he had the
plague. There was the scent of violets in her hair as
it brushed his shoulder—a warm, wet fragrance, born
of the night-time breeze—that unsteadied him. He
had thought himself past that sort of blandishment,
since Nita and he shared courting-days; but his heart
found a quicker beat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She withdrew sharply, ashamed of her weakness and
blaming him for it. “Rebecca was so sure that you
were killed on the way home,” she said. “I could not
comfort her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca herself was in a fine, gusty rage. She had
gone through much in the last hour, and the relief from
foreboding asked for outlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will say this, Master, though I let my tongue be
still most times. Outrageous folk, men are. They’ll
go pleasuring to market, in spite o’ Garsykes being out
against ’em. They’ll let their women moil and toil for
’em, and wait their coming—and, like as you might say
for frolic, they’ll come an hour late to supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle could understand her wrath no better
than Causleen’s tears. It seemed to him simply that
the two of them were daft. But then most women
were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was kept,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, you were kept—and the best supper ever
cooked is spoiling to a cinder. And you never stopped
to think I should be picturing you dead on the roadway
all this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon was racing through a scud of cloud, and
Rebecca peered through the silver dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you got on your saddle?” she asked
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm, poor brute. He fell asleep on the journey,
worn out with it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca’s gusty mood pointed south-west now,
instead of shrill nor’-east. “Then I’m glad you’re
late. Shepherd Brant was in my kitchen just now,
boasting he’d put lead into Storm at last and that he’d
die of it among the brackens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came near it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe; but a miss is as good as a mile. I sent
Brant stamping out, with a flea in his big, hairy ear—and,
as for Storm, poor lamb, we’ll mend his legs for
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master had lifted Storm already from saddle.
The dog bit feebly at him, and writhed in pain; but his
growling ceased when he found himself in the old
quarters that had grown to be home and respite to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca ran in search of linen and a cunning ointment
she bought from the gypsies who came peddling
to her door, and then Causleen, wise with dogs, held the
rough head while Hardcastle felt down the maimed
hindquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing broken,” he said, glancing up,
“but Brant fired at close range, damn him. Storm’s
flesh has gaps in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep-slayer had gone through evil days—hunger
while they hunted him, and after it the straddling out
in search of cover after Brant had left him with two legs
to go on instead of four. So he let them do what they
would with him, though Rebecca’s ointment galled his
wounds as she plied them with no gentle fingers. This
was ease after hardship—three folk attentive on him,
and a snug lodging for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cunning ointment, its bite sharp at first, began to
soothe, and Storm dozed happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor lamb, he’s bettering now,” said Rebecca,
wiping her fingers on a scrap of linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle laughed quietly. “There are lambs that
were never born because he slew the ewes. But he’s
ours, Rebecca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood together in the silence. Peril brooded
like thunder-weather over the house of Logie. The
wind, chattering and plucking at the casements, spoke of
stealth, of nameless treacheries closing round about its
walls. The pedlar was crying in his sleep for another
glimpse of Ben Crummock before he died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do as they would, gloom spun its webs about them—little,
clinging webs that hindered courage—till Jonah,
the brindled cat, stalked down the passage. Storm’s
protest when they tended the wounds had roused Jonah
from his sleep, and he came to learn what ailed an
ancient comrade. His thick, handsome coat was all
a-bristle, his eyes green and combative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jonah paid no heed to Rebecca, but stepped into the
cupboard and glanced at the sheep-slayer, and mewed
restlessly. Storm lifted his head drowsily and growled
a welcome, and the brindled cat curled himself into the
dog’s shaggy neck and looked out on all intruders with
defiance. Then they licked each other once or twice
and fell into a deep slumber of content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to him,” said Rebecca, with a cackle of glee.
“Listen to vagabones Jonah. He’s purring as loud as
an eight-day clock, Lord bless him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eerie hour of dread was broken. Causleen
glanced at the Master, and for the first time since they
shared Logie’s roof they laughed together. Then she
grew wide-eyed and grave again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your hands are raw!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm did not know me just at first. They’ll heal,”
said Hardcastle.</p>

<h3>WILL O’ WISP</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Near dusk of the quiet November day a man came
into Widow Mathison’s inn at Garsykes and
called for a quart of home-brewed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you pay?” asked the widow, with her buxom,
loose-lipped smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer the man took a handful of silver from his
pocket and laid it on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right enough, and no offence meant. Time
was when I chalked the tally up on my door—but I
tired o’ that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would—from all I hear of Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’re free enough with their money when
they have any. It’s just that they seldom have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow, after bustling to serve him, went on with
her interrupted dusting of the china dogs on the mantel,
till curiosity got the better of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you travelled far, like?” she asked over her
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so very,” chuckled the stranger, “though I
came near to going a very far way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say, now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, but I do say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where might it be you nearly went?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as you ask me—hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger chuckled afresh as he buried his head
in his pewter-pot. And Long Murgatroyd came
striding in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dry, Murgatroyd?” asked the widow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a kiln.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew a man so punctual, as you might say,
to a thirst. Tend it, you do, as a woman tends her
babby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd was in one of his better moods, and
gave as much as he took in the way of banter before
settling himself in the corner by the ingle-nook. Then
he glanced at the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where do you come from?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless me, the landlady was putting that same
question to me a minute since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” snapped the widow, “and all the answer I
got for my trouble was that he’d nearly journeyed
further than he relished—journeyed to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be squeamish. Hell was what I said—if
there <span class='it'>is</span> such a place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd turned on him with a sudden snarl.
“There is. I don’t need to travel, for I’m in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door was pushed open again, and two more
Garsykes Men came in, bringing the smell of a soft,
wet breeze across the stale sawdust of the tavern
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They in turn glanced curiously at the stranger, but
he forestalled them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to be first with a question this time. Is
it true that such as me is safe in Garsykes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That all depends,” said Murgatroyd, recovering his
good humour. “Have you done aught again the
law?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A tidy bit in my time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such as?” growled one of the late comers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the last thing I did, as I said, was to come
nearer Kingdom Come than ever I’d been in my life. A
running post-boy was due, not a hundred miles from
where we’re sitting, and I wanted what he’d got.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was no more than reasonable, as you might
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d got more than I bargained for—a pistol and a
spirit of his own. I closed with him just in time—and
here’s the mark of the bullet where it grazed my
neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They saw the red weal he turned to them, then
glanced at the silver he had thrown on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that all you got for your trouble?” asked
Murgatroyd. “You’re not safe here, my lad, if you
show the silver and keep the guineas hid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger got up, and clapped his empty pockets,
and bade the men search him; but his rueful smile made
it clear that he was hiding no ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was searching for the guineas when a man galloped
over the hill—a big man—and spat a pistol at me
as I ran. That bullet, too, touched me—on the leg
this time. So I took cover, and headed straight for
Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three men laughed, and so did Widow Mathison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did right,” said the widow. “By what you say,
it was our masterful Man o’ Logie rode at you; but even
he durst not come seeking you in Garsykes. We’re
seeking him instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carried a pistol, did he?” grumbled Murgatroyd.
“Well, there’s one boast gone from Logie. The
Master said he’d face us all with no more than his two
fists and a stick to help him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger called for bread-and-cheese and another
pot of ale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you seeking him?” he asked lazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he’s too big for his boots, and always was.
So now he’s got all Garsykes against him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he’s wise to carry a pistol, I should say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He swore he wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, but I’d have found a quick change o’ mind
myself—if Garsykes pressed me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd eyed him with sombre doubt. “What’s
you’re name when you’re at home, my lad? You
seem to know a lot about Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t a home. That’s why I’m known as Will
o’ Wisp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Master of Logie touched you with a bullet—and
you sit grinning there as if he’d given you ale and
crumpets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never cry over spilled luck. That’s what the
road teaches a free-striding man. Besides, there was
comfort met me on a little, grey brig o’ stone.” The
man’s eyes twinkled with random, inborn gaiety. “I
never saw such a lass in my life—slim and like a posy,
and she was weaving a basket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd stirred restlessly, but his neighbour
kicked him by stealth and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be Nita,” said the widow—“Nita, the
basket-maker, as we call her. Poor bairn, she was left
an orphan——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t trouble her now,” broke in Will o’
Wisp, with his heedless laugh. “She smiled so kindly
as I went by that I asked the way to Garsykes. And
it ended with my sitting on the brig beside her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does,” said Murgatroyd, heavily. “It always
ends like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again his shin was kicked, and Widow Mathison took
up the tale they were spinning round the stranger like a
web.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s of the better sort, you see, and our Garsykes
Men are rough. No wonder that she smiled at the likes of
you. I’d have done as much myself when I was younger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The widow’s right. Nita’s too trim a lass for such
as us. That’s why she looks over our heads when we
think o’ courting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t court properly, then,” said Will o’ Wisp,
with a wink of infinite zest and roguery. “There’s
three ways of courting a pretty wench, and only three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aye?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first is, be sure of winning. So’s the second.
And the third——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the third?” prompted Widow Mathison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be sure of winning,” Will o’ Wisp chuckled, and
buried his face in the pewter-pot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so pleased with the hum of laughter that
answered his idle pleasantry—pleased to be safe among
Lost Folk again after hunger and thirst among the
righteous—and his tongue wagged freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They plied him with strong ale that night, and
Murgatroyd, when he left him sleeping on the long-settle,
went laughing out of the tavern door. He
would watch another go through what he had suffered—would
watch, and gloat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd glanced up the grey fells, as he swayed
unsteadily for a moment when the breeze found the ale
in him. Then he strode up to his cottage under
Scummer Rigg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will o’ Wisp courts Will o’ Wisp,” he muttered,
with a big, joyous hiccough. “The devilment there’ll
be in Garsykes.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>About five of that November evening, Hardcastle
had come to his house of Logie and heard a woman’s
voice as he stepped into the hall after stabling his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Storm, be quiet,” she chided. “You’ve had
two weeks of nursing, and you’re nearly well. I’ll not
have you snap at me. But then all sick folk are that
way,” she went on, coaxing and scolding in the same
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was changing the sheep-slayer’s bandages, and
glanced up at Hardcastle with a smile of welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s strong enough to need a male nurse now.
Will you do the rest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm tried his fretful temper on the Master, but not
for long. He did not whimper even as the ointment
stung and galled before it soothed; for he knew that
the days of his pamperdom were nearly over—and that
Hardcastle knew it, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had licked himself for a while, then settled
into sleep, Causleen and Hardcastle stood in the
draughty hall, glancing at each other with the new
understanding that had come by stealth to them
during these last days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald—how is he?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little nearer the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had driven pity out of his life, had
bruised it with his heel at every turn. He was impatient
to find it stirring faintly now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish Logie was a safer lodging for you. You’ve
trouble enough of your own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The note in his voice, the haunted look that showed
in his eyes for a moment and was gone, told her of some
encounter on the road to-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it Long Murgatroyd again, with a rope across the
highway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you know of that?” he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you hid the news well enough, but gossip
brought it. What happened to-night as you rode from
Norbrigg?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing that mattered—for me. But for you and
Donald——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It matters for all of us, or none,” she broke in, her
glance questioning and steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said roughly. “The end for Logie is sure,
so far as I can see. But I’d hoped the house would last
Donald’s time. He’s earned a peaceful end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen seemed ever to be finding some unexpected
waywardness in Hardcastle. He waged the feud so
quietly, with such contempt for his own safety, that
she had thought him deaf to what was no news on Logie-side.
He, too, was aware that his house was doomed,
it seemed; yet he found time to think of Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened to-night?” she asked again.
“I’d rather have the tale from you than wait for
gossip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then he told her of his ride up-fell from Norbrigg,
and how he found a post-boy holding his own with
hardship against a footpad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent a bullet after him—and, the last I saw of the
rogue, he was limping hard for Garsykes. It’s only
one more count in their tally against me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could buy your house—at a price,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What price?” He was rough and hard on the
instant—rough as Storm, sleeping his sickness off in the
cupboard near at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could give them tribute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And sell Logie’s honour? I couldn’t. Seven
hundred years would rive open the graves down yonder,
where dead Hardcastles lie. They’d rise and flout me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen’s eyes glowed bright and clear. “It would
be so easy,” she said, tempting him, “to pay a little to
them every now and then—and your house safe—and
no ropes stretched across night-roads.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glowered down at her. “And no peace
by day or night. Logie would know. Her timbers
would creak and groan. She’d loose her ancient
ghosts on me—and God knows every house has ghosts
enough of that sort. You’re mad to talk of giving
tribute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had probed to the core of him, as she had meant;
and a great need came to her, out of the weary years
behind, to speak of the tribute asked of Donald and
herself—which had been denied in face of odds as great
as he was facing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two pedlars came to your door,” she said, with a
flash of the old grievance. “You counted us as such,
and no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And shall never be forgiven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m tired and out of heart, and you have been kind—kinder
than you need have been. And we still
intrude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all; but his denial had a new ring of truth
about it, though she could find no reason for the change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had lands of our own once,” she went on by and
by—“lands and a house like yours. But they went.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tearless grief, too deep for Hardcastle
to fathom, in those three words, “But they went.”
Logie was going, unless a miracle arrived; but he would
die with the house, when the last onset of the Garsykes
Men prevailed. He had no such parting to face as
Causleen had gone through—exile from a homestead
whose every stone and draughty corridor was loved like
a second self. Logie and he, when their time came,
would face the Trump o’ Doom together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me more,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she halted, fearing that grief would get the
better of her, Rebecca came down the passage with a
martial tread. The brindled cat was on her shoulder,
his fur raised in warlike challenge, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Logie lands breed slack-come-by men these days,
Master. Such a twitter as there’s been in my kitchen.
You’d have fancied women were talking, though they
wore breeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who were they, Rebecca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phineas Rowbotham first, squealing that he was a
man of peace. Bloodshed was a sin, said he, and why
shouldn’t we pay our way with the Garsykes Folk—living,
and letting live. I was dusting his jacket with
a rolling-pin when another steps in with the same tale,
and another. So I swept them out, and barred the
door. Jonah spat at ’em from my shoulder, same as
he’s sitting now. Jonah knows men’s flesh and blood
from chicken-meat. Spat and growled at ’em, he did,
as a man cat should.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen felt a sudden sense of home. Hardcastle
had not the Highland speech, nor Rebecca; but they
three were one in the spirit to endure. And Storm
and the brindled cat were with them.</p>

<h3>NITA</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Garsykes was stirred to grim and crafty mirth
during the next weeks. November had brought
its little spell of summer between fall of the
leaves and winter’s onset. Primroses bloomed here
and there in favoured nooks. The sun was constant,
from dawn till nightfall, in a blue and happy sky,
and birds began to think of courtship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So did Will o’ Wisp. In all his careless, vagabond
life he had found none like Nita; and she smiled at
him whenever they met by stream or coppice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our men are rough and savage,” she would say.
“They frighten me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Will o’ Wisp would yield to the slender helplessness
of this girl who showed him open favour.
And all Garsykes laughed, to watch the stranger
going the way of many men before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has him in her lap,” growled Long Murgatroyd,
sitting in the inn one afternoon among his cronies,
“and the Lord knows which o’ them I’d like to throttle
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Choose Nita,” they answered, in snarling chorus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happen I will,” said Murgatroyd, and fell back
into the sullen brooding that shadowed his every
thought these days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp cared nothing at all for what they
said of him in Garsykes. He cared only to be with
Nita Langrish, to grow wilder each day for her elusive
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one of these windless, moist afternoons, near
dusk, he came from the benty lands and found her
at the bridge that spanned Crooning Water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a fine hare you’re dangling in your hand,”
she said, with a welcoming smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking to leave it at your door as I went
by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d best come with you, then, as soon as I’ve
finished my basket. Hares left at Garsykes doors
don’t stay there long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They wouldn’t,” agreed Will o’ Wisp, with a
random laugh. “I should have thought of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d best keep it, after all. What do I know
of the way to skin it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have thought of that, too. I’ll bring it
dressed for cooking—and don’t blame me if it looks
like a plump, naked cat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seemed to invite him to sit on the parapet
beside her; but when he tried to put an arm about her,
it grasped only empty space. Nita was on the far
side of the bridge, as if by magic, threading her withies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They used to cut the willows for me,” she said by
and by, her voice soft as the breeze that fluted down
the stream. “And now I have to cut them myself.
See how rough my hands are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were held out to him—slim, shapely hands—and
he was mad to take them. But Nita was already
standing in the roadway, and laughed as she dangled
the finished basket to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is for little Tabitha, up dale. Seventy odd
and a spinster, she. The last I made was for a bride.
I wonder what drollery will come to them both, when
they take their baskets over-arm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp’s crisp good-humour failed him. The
girl stood there, all of her but the grey eyes young as
June about these winter highlands; but the eyes were
old, unfathomable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What drollery should come?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would not understand. I cannot help it,
but I’ve a trick of weaving spells into my baskets.
Whoever I make one for, I get a picture of her in my
mind, and ply the willows in and out with a sort of
prayer, you might say, that my basket will teach her
just the daft contrary-wise of what she thought she
was. And it comes true, Will o’ Wisp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly the grey eyes were young again,
and smiling into his. “Was I seeing far? It comes
of foregathering with gypsies. One of them talked
to me just now of Logie and its Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man who tried to stop me with a bullet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you bear no malice, Will o’ Wisp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should do,” he chuckled, “but, thanks be, I
harbour none o’ that. I’ve seen too much of it in
my time—eating into men like a plague.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have had the post-boy’s money in your
pocket, but for Hardcastle. And what cause had
he to interfere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His bullet only flicked me. Next time I’ll flick
him, maybe, and settle that little account between
us. But, as for malice, I wouldn’t sour myself with
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not like the Garsykes sort. They’d gnaw
at what Hardcastle did to you, as a dog gnaws at a
bone, never letting it rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More fools they. I’m a rogue by nature and choice—a
light-hearted one—and fancied they’d be all like
that in Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fancied wrong, Will o’ Wisp. Honour among
thieves—Robin Hood and his merry men—you looked
to find all that in Garsykes? You’re young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re young,” he broke in heedlessly. “You
were talking of spells you wove into your baskets,
Nita—as if baskets mattered. You’ve woven them
round a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or half a man?” she mocked. “One who lets
Hardcastle pistol him and daren’t answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp grew taut as a bow-string on the sudden.
“<span class='it'>Dare not</span> never shadowed me since I was breeked.
I’ve little to boast about except that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went together up the road, and turned into
the track that led between lean, benty lands to
Garsykes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Hardcastle had done a wrong to me?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gripped her shoulder till she winced. “I’d
kill him,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man, are you, after all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was born one, as it happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s not so bad as to ask murder,” said Nita,
her voice gentle as a dove’s. “Hardcastle slighted
me—no more than that—took the heart out of my
body and threw it away for frolic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he?” said Will o’ Wisp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not murder,” she pleaded, her hand like velvet
on his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s as maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then she cried, and he fell to comforting her;
and afterwards she set the width of the roadway
between them as they went through Garsykes village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prying eyes looked out on them from Widow Mathison’s
inn, and Long Murgatroyd fetched a great laugh
as he stood looking out of the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s another o’ Nita’s goes by. To-morrow
he’ll be where most of us have been in our time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd spoke truth. On the next day Will o’
Wisp was busy in the swampy hollow where Nita’s
willows grew. The Garsykes Men, when they got
late abroad, did not pause for banter as they passed.
They let the newcomer hang himself in Nita’s silken
toils, and so much for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it went for many days, till Will o’ Wisp began to
lose his content with life as he found it. There were
times when he came into the inn and sat silent on the
settle, till at last the widow rallied him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re getting heavy as Murgatroyd. What’s
amiss with your easy-go-lucky handling of things as
they come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should I know? Draw me a quart of ale,
and maybe that will cure me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it will—and likely it willun’t. But
Nita’s good for my trade, and always was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said naught about Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But you were thinking of her. Will o’
Wisp, my lad, I’ve a liking for you, and I’m old enough
to be your mother. Quit Nita Langrish, before she
binds her spell too fast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rough sympathy was too much for him. He
had gone through evil days—through beguilement
that promised all, and gave nothing but the slant
flight of a snipe as it raced down-wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spell’s over me, fast and hard,” he said, and
laughed—but not with the old relish.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The next day Nita came home by way of the Long
Spinney that raked down from Logie to the grey hill-fastness
where her village lurked. Her step was
buoyant. She had sold her baskets, and had another
man in thrall at Garsykes. All was well with her,
till a gunshot cracked from the spinney, and Hardcastle
came presently down the lane between the
thick-set firs and sycamores, dangling a hare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sight of him—big and careless, as if the world
were his—Nita lost all content. There was one who
had escaped her snare, and she coveted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man they call Will o’ Wisp brought me just
such a hare—and it was one of yours, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he? I’m taking mine to Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the pedlar’s brat to share?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, as yet, knew nothing of his heart;
but Nita read it in his stubborn quietness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say to her, that day you met her
on the road?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something that brought burning to her cheeks.
Do you think, because you’re Hardcastle of Logie,
you can share a hut for the night with a lass and hear
no more about it—snowstorm or no?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are times,” he said slowly, “when I wonder
why one or another of the Garsykes Men doesn’t cut
out that tongue of yours and nail it where the gamekeeper——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nails vermin?” said Nita gently. “I witch
them, Hardcastle of Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle longed to pass by, and could not. Surely
what they said of her was false. She was so fresh
and innocent, like a morning in mid-April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I witch them, Dick, and care for none—since
you went out of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she was witching him, too. All that was
rough and a man in him had asked always for a frail
thing like Nita to guard—something that would need
his strength and lean on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were good days, and I lost them,” she went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if a net of cobwebs hindered him. She
was close, and woe-begone, and pleading. Then he
remembered how it had gone long since—his stormy,
honest wooing—and the end of that good dream.
He recalled the barren years, his loathing of all women
for Nita’s sake—Nita’s, who had played him false.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re of Garsykes,” he said, “and the new days
are in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have been of Logie once. I was a fool.
Have you no pity, Dick?” She put a hand on his
sleeve. “You’re built out of limestone rock—hard
and unforgiving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just hard, Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And buying acres here and there, to add to Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bought a farm yesterday—Nicholas Wade’s, who
died in his bed at ninety. Yes, I’m buying acres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t you save them, Dick? I’m of the
Wilderness—and there are only six of yours that do
not cringe to Garsykes. You’re almost alone against
us now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe—but the six are staunch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita would have welcomed rage—his hands at her
throat, for what she had done to him in days gone
by—but she fretted at this cold hardihood that was
so resolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you no pity?” she asked again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I keep such for Logie these times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly he found her hands in his, and the old
beguilement was about him. She had tempted him
before, when the feud was new and heady in his veins,
and he had hope of saving Logie. Now he had no
hope, except to face the last assault of Garsykes when
it came, and die with the house whose every rafter-beam
he loved. Six of his men had proved leal.
The rest were chaff blowing down the winds of chance—folk
cringing for daily bread to Garsykes, and paying
toll as if they cared not for the shame of licking dirty
boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All was in the losing. And here was Nita, her arms
soft about him. What did it matter, if he took and
claimed her, and earned restful days for Logie?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fight was over almost before he knew it had
begun. Pride played its own part. He would not
yield, though twenty Garsykes came against him.
But, deep under pride, lay some inner depth whose
waters had not been stirred till now. Nita and her
spells grew shadowy and weak. He was a free man
again, and some new, undreamed-of world seemed to
open out before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita stood at arm’s length now, wondering at the
man’s stubbornness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we’re both fools, it seems,” she said. “I lost
Logie once for vanity—and now you’re losing it for
pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A twig snapped in the wood behind them, and Hardcastle
turned sharply. He saw only a shaking of the
pine-branches; but Nita had seen more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid that one from Garsykes would club you
from behind?” she mocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not afraid—but sure it would be from behind,
if at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you loathe us, Dick—and how we loathe you in
turn. Listen. I’m as you see me—not ugly, they
say—and there’s a mad-dog fury there in Garsykes.
They want to burn your house to-morrow, and I will
not let them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” snapped Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope to be mistress there. Would I let them
burn a house I shared?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never share it,” he said bluntly, stung by
her careless trust in her own beauty and its power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita stood regarding him for a moment, then laughed—a
little, eerie laugh that had an edge of steel. “I’ll
not let them burn the house for another reason now.
It would be too easy a way out for its pride-sick
master. You’re glancing at the wood again? It was
no Garsykes face that peeped between the branches.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose was it, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, whose? You’ll learn soon enough—and,
after all, it’s only one more trouble to your load.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence followed, heavy and brooding as thunder-weather
brewing up. Nita, used to swaying men by
her lightest smile, had done all to bring Hardcastle
into captivity again. She had failed, and the Master
drew back a pace or two, appalled by what he saw in
the girl’s face and dove-like eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall teach them the way of better sport with
Logie than burning it. You’d only die once in the
flames. For weeks, maybe—or months—the Wilderness
will let you go your ways. A mischance here and
there, to let you know we’re not asleep—the waiting
for a blow that will surely come at last—do you think
pride will carry any man through that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Hardcastle, and went up the pastures,
swinging the hare he carried.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Nita turned at last, when he was out of sight, and
went down the track to Garsykes. Heart she had
none to be wounded, but vanity was touched to the
quick. Hardcastle would never be moved by her
spells from this to the Crack o’ Doom, and with the
knowledge came a passionate gust of hate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this mood that she encountered Will o’
Wisp, lumbering to the inn on heavy feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not your own merry self,” she said. “What
ails you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita Langrish ails me. I get no rest for wanting
of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do all the men go daft for the little basket-weaver?
I never ask it, Will o’ Wisp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” he growled, “but the lord Harry knows
you maze us. I could throttle you where we stand,
Nita—just for love of doing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t. I’d put a hand on your arm—like
this—and I’d ask you to be gentle with little Nita.
And, see, you could not hurt me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stood there, smiling foolishly, and lost
to all but the girl’s low, pleading voice. And she
began to play on his infirmities, as skilled fingers
might touch a fiddle’s strings, till she brought him
to her purpose. It was true that she had checked
the Wilderness Men in their second plot to fire Logie.
It had been true, till her meeting with Logie’s Master,
that she had crooned happily to herself as she wove
her baskets, and planned the long do-little time which
should break Hardcastle’s spirit and his pride before
they broke his body. But now she could not wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vanity, restless and impatient, cried for solace
to its wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do I fret you so, Will o’ Wisp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s past my wits to say. Happen you know
yourself, and happen you don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Hardcastle of Logie, and not one in
Garsykes dares bring him down—for my sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your sake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You’re half-men, all of you, or we’d be rid
of him. I met him up the pastures awhile since,
and he—he was not kind. If I’d had you with me,
Will o’ Wisp—but you were drinking strong ale,
likely, instead of being at my side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was lad-mooning up and down the fields, sick
of my fancy for you. And naught ever comes of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lad-moon no more, Will. Be up and doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” he asked bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not his match in strength—but little folk
are given nimble wits. He took a pistol to you once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did,” muttered Will, urged now by a rancour
Nita had fostered diligently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s turn and turn about in this life. Borrow
Murgatroyd’s fowling-piece to-morrow——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And creep up to Logie with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no need. All gossip comes to little Nita,
and I can tell you the way home Hardcastle will be
taking, near dusk. It lies yonder, where the track
dips down from Pengables—and, when you’ve fired,
Will o’ Wisp, you’ve no more to do than slip home to
Garsykes for your welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of welcome?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d find me, for one. What I’d give the man
who rid Logie-side of Hardcastle—but, then, you’re
only half-man, maybe, like the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that, Will o’ Wisp was in the toils again;
and as they went down to Garsykes, the basket-weaver
nestled close against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, meanwhile, had taken his own grim way
to Logie—over the bridge of many memories and up
the winding steep of the road. His gate, when he
reached it, held memories, too, and he fingered the
arrow-head left there as a token before the autumn
trees were stripped. He kept it in his pocket nowadays,
for luck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stable-lad, sweeping the lane, touched his forelock
as Hardcastle came by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s been Farmer Draycott to see you, Master,
but he couldn’t wait till you came back. You
promised to go to Broken Firs to-morrow about
repairs, and he stepped up to remind you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d not forgotten,” said Hardcastle carelessly—“though
it’s a long message for you to carry, William.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lad grinned sheepishly. “It did twist the few
wits I’ve got; but I just kept on saying it over and
over—not letting go in a manner o’ speaking, like as
if I stuck to a rope.—And, Master——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d not go if I was you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glanced at him with gruff kindliness;
for all Logie humoured this lad of the strong hands and
the lame wits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not if Guytrash yelped behind and druv me forrard.
I’d choose Trash, I would, instead o’ Broken Firs.
Why d’ye go, Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I said I’d go—so fret no more, William,
and take this hare up to the kitchen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He missed the wistful, dog-like glance that followed
him up the lane. He was thinking of Nita Langrish—of
Causleen, who was a guest thrust on him against
his will. Donald the pedlar wearied him, too, though
he hated himself for the thought that pensioners
lingered in their dying. Surely there was enough to
face these days, without useless burdens to carry on
one’s back! What did he owe Donald and his girl?
Why were they here, when Logie asked for all his
strength, and no weaklings in the house?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, when he came under his own roof, he was
aware of loneliness. Donald, as he glanced into the
room, was sleeping tranquilly. Rebecca, far down
the passage, seemed to be at war with Jonah, the
brindled cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A vagabones I call you, lapping cream all day
and doing naught,” came the shrill voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Hardcastle wearied of it all. Peril, of the
stealthy kind that he was fighting, had made his body
lean and nagged at his spirit till it was raw with wounds.
Something was absent—something he had come to
look for on returning—and he grew restless and
impatient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca came down the passage by and by, Jonah
perched on her shoulder after the last of their soon-over
quarrels. With swift and savage intuition she
knew what ailed the Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pedlar does well enough. Are you worrying
about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Hardcastle, tall and sombre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for his girl, she came in awhile since like a
child o’ Belial. After she’d seen to Donald, she was
frost and venom. She wouldn’t speak—I could have
thoyled it better that road—but flounced about in her
quiet, proud way, till I could have bitten her. Then
she went out o’ doors—at this time o’ night, and with
all Garsykes stirring for aught we know—and she’s
not come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle turned to the rack, reached for a fowling-piece
and looked to the priming. Then, without a
word to Rebecca, he went into the soft November
night and stood listening for the cry of one in trouble.
None came. A sickle moon lay cradled in the tree-tops,
shining on a land of misty quiet; and in that
moment Hardcastle learned something of the heart
he had thought walled-up for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called, and silence answered. Crying louder and
louder still, he went up and down the pastures, through
the home-spinney and out into Chantry Meadow where
the cowslips grew in spring. He began to weave
pictures of Garsykes Men surrounding her from every
corner of these empty wastes, and quickened pace,
and went circling hither and thither like a man distraught.
Gusty anger found him, passionate question
why she had left Logie’s shelter—fear reached him, of
a kind unknown till now—and again his cry rang
out—his heart’s cry of <span class='it'>Causleen</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bunch of sheep, huddled under the wall, got up
and ran bleak-witted past him. That was the only
answer. And now his own littleness appalled Hardcastle.
Measured by the striding loneliness of Logie-land,
he seemed small and of no account. He must
get back, and saddle a horse, and rouse the country-side.
If they found Causleen safe—if they found
her safe—his mind stayed there awhile, glad to believe
it till he was half-way back to Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then his mind raced forward. If they found her
dead, or worse, he’d gather his roving company into
a band that would burn Garsykes from one end to
the other of its styes. Hardcastle, the magistrate who
once had scrupled to carry a gun against the Lost
Folk, was growing fast these days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came to his own door, wrath and fear between
them making havoc of him. And there stood Causleen,
looking quietly out across the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely you heard me call?” snapped Hardcastle,
with quick relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why the devil, child, didn’t you answer?
I’ve been sick with fear for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that true?” she asked. “There’s no other
could make you sick with fear of that sort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle was no easy man to live with these days.
His temper was brittle as a file, and here was the pedlar’s
girl, cross-questioning him after the turmoil he had
gone through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a fool,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To get my heart into my mouth because——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because, Hardcastle of Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rebecca told me you’d gone out alone, as if there
were no Wilderness Men skulking round the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you cared to go in search?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a fool,” said Hardcastle again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at him once, in the light of the young,
keen moon—and laughed at him with quiet derision—and
went indoors, to find Rebecca waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back, are you? Well, it’s time. The Master’s
been daft about you—and Jonah sits atop o’ your
shoulder now, instead o’ mine—so I’m getting jealous
all ways. What made you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The owls were hooting in Logie Wood. They
seemed to call me,” said Causleen, aloof and cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pack o’ nonsense. Why couldn’t you let the
hullets get on with their decent hunting? It was the
dratted voles and rats they were crying for. And now
you’ll want supper, on top of my hard day’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I could not eat, Rebecca. So you’re spared
that trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca, noting the girl’s sudden pallor, was grimmer
than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spared more from your pack o’ nonsense, am I?
I’ll see to that. It’s a good, square meal you need,
my lass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen faced her with a dignity so aloof that it
daunted even tough Rebecca. “I eat as little as
may be of your Master’s food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she was gone up the windy stairway,
like a Highland storm across her own far moors; and
presently Hardcastle came in, dour and stubborn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“William brought you the hare?” he asked, finding
Rebecca still in the hall, chewing the cud of her defeat
at Causleen’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and more. He prayed me draw you back
from going to Broken Firs to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of that? William’s wits were never strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But his far-sight is. Suppose he’s right, Master—and
suppose you knew he was right—would you
still go up to Michael Draycott’s?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else should I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lean, hard smile wrinkled the woman’s lips.
“Aye,” she said. “Aye. That’s Logie, through and
through.”</p>

<h3>THE HINDERED VENTURE</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Michael Draycott was waiting for him
at the gate when Hardcastle came over the
moor to Broken Firs the next afternoon, and
he nodded a cheery greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re on the very stroke of the time you promised,
Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to be, Michael. You’re so often near dying
that a minute beyond might be too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I willun’t have that old joke thrown at me,”
chuckled the farmer. “Maybe I have my fancies,
like one here and there; but I do get up from my
death-bed wonderful regular.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then you want to dip into my pockets for
repairs. It would pay me to keep you ill in bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the long run, when roofs began to gape and
gates dropped all to bits. There’d be a tidier penny
to pay then than now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have it your own way, Michael, but remember
I’m a poor man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ancient ritual went its way, as they moved
from one corner to another of the trim farmstead—Hardcastle
with shrewd reluctance, Michael with deep
resolve to get all he wanted, and a little more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little more was broached as Hardcastle was
leaving, after a wide-spread meal in the farmstead’s
parlour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talking of mistals——” said Michael.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We didn’t happen to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but we were thinking o’ them. That one
yonder would be all the better if it was doubled in size.
The farm’s prospering so, I’ve scarcely room for my
beasts to turn about in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Michael, you’re bound to die soon, in one of
those bad turns of yours. You’d better be thinking
of your latter end, instead of farm-buildings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s weather-red face grew plump with laughter.
“I’m not on such nodding-terms with death as
I used to be, Master. There’s summat in this durned
feud with Garsykes that makes me want to live to a
hundred and three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Six of us feel like that,” said Hardcastle, glancing
down to where Garsykes caught the last of the crimson
sun-glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and six o’ that sort can be fifty or two-score
when need asks. I couldn’t have thought it—the
way old bones grow young in these good times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All they had shared of peril lay silent between them,
but confessed, as they watched the last glow redden
and die out across the Garsykes hollow, leaving it to
a grey, disastrous sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go agateards with you, Master,” said Draycott
by and by—“lest young blood gets the better of you,
and you run single-handed into yond foul stye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no likelihood, Michael. I’m ready for
them if they come to Logie, and it stands at that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but you’re young. And youth can’t bide to
wait sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael went with him as far as the turn of the track,
where the heather ran down to the pastures; and then
he bade him a hale good-night and God-speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a sick heifer needing me, Master—and, forgive
me, I was thinking of the feud instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle swung down the track. The sun had
westered now about these higher slopes, and dusk overtook
him as he reached the top of the sheep-track that
wound to Logie. Across the frost-haze of the valley,
lights twinkled out from Garsykes one by one, and he
laughed grimly as he stood and watched them. Tired
wayfarers might mistake them for stars of hope,
might blunder out of the hill-top wastes into such
welcome as waited for them there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A harsh joy in feud came to him. The end of Logie
was sure as anything could be in this world, but he
would hold his good house to the last. There would be
no surrender, and with a quick flash of humour he
pictured Rebecca playing a besom heftily amid the
flaming havoc of her kitchen. And Storm, maybe,
after much red sheep-slaying, would kill a man or two
of the Wilderness, and so die an honest dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old days of peace and money-getting were
remote as a dream remembered on waking to full life.
Out there, behind the twinkling lamp-gleams, were
men and women plotting now, no doubt, some crafty
lighter blow before they came in force against the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Death had seemed, in those old days, an end to life,
a sorrowful laying away of folk under green turf that
stopped their ears for ever to the wheeling cries of
moor-birds—closed their nostrils to savour of wind
and sun and rain across the striding lands—ended all
things and all joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as he stood looking over the wandering valley
mists, he seemed, for one bewildering moment, to see
with clearer vision. For Logie’s honour he had grappled
with the three gaunt men who met him at the
pinfold—was it weeks or years ago?—and since then
death had shadowed him. Aye, but was death more
than a stride from one life to another? What if,
for men who had loved the homeland, there were wider
moors beyond, and sweeter winds and lustier joy in
strength?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought stayed with him. New horizons
widened over widening hill-spaces. What if death
were no wormy end of life, but a beginning of new days?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No breeze ruffled these upland wastes. Little
frets of night-time life stirred among the gnarled
heather and the bents. The land’s soul was in a mood
as deep and still as Hardcastle’s, and a fine communion
held between the Master who was a lover to his acres,
the acres that loved him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He roused himself at last, with another laugh at
Garsykes and himself, and was turning to swing down
the sheep-track when a cry broke sharp as a pistol-shot
across the moor. It sounded close at hand.
Then a second cry came—far-off, it seemed—and
another. Hardcastle peered through the dark that
had scarcely served to show him a yard of the track
ahead. He could see nothing, but the cries rose to a
shriek of terror, and he ran forward, this way and that,
forgetting that the moor was thick with ambush.
Twice he sucked a foot out from the bog, and once he
blundered against a rock that cut deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the cries sounded, weaker now. The darkness
baffled hearing, as well as sight, after a fashion of
its own. Someone was dying, near at hand, and
Hardcastle could not find him. The failing cries
maddened his will to save—the will that would have
gone through six-foot drifts to save sheep over-blown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the grey haze lifted. A brave, young moon
shone over Logie-land—over the misty hollow, and
across to Garsykes—and, not twenty paces off, Hardcastle
saw a little lad, half of him buried in green slime.
In his haste to get to him, the Master was all but lost
himself; for his heavier weight crashed through the
ooze that was less firm even than true bogland. He
sank to his knees before touching firm ground on the
sloping brink of the marsh, then reached forward and
gripped the lad’s upstretched arms; and never afterwards,
in trying to recall what followed, could he
remember anything but a struggle that seemed endless.
Each tug, to drag the boy towards him, unsteadied
his own foothold; and, when he had him in his arms,
the fight to regain dry land again brought every muscle
thick-standing and near to breaking-point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to firm ground at last, and the boy clung
about him with piteous cries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want my mammy—oh, I want my mammy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t be that—and, be damned to you,
you’re a wet sort of lad to father. Where d’ye hail
from, laddie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glanced across the narrow valley, and
back again to the boy. Tired as he was, exasperated
by the simple answer, the humour of it all appealed
to him. Apart from peril of other marshes he might
blunder into, how could he let this waif go lonely with
his fright across the mile that would seem endless
leagues to him—the mile that stretched between this
and Garsykes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing for it but to go—a fool, knowing
the way of the Lost Folk and their mercies—into the
midst of what they had in store for him. Rebel as
he would against suicide of this sort, he could not
thrust aside a lad who shivered as he clung to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they two went across the moonlit wilderness,
picking their way between the bogs and the broken
grounds. It was not easy going. The light was
enough to show them a safe way till clouds came over
the moon’s face now and then, and they were alone
with darkness and the unfenced mines that lurked
for heedless feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle’s temper grew rusty as a file. He was
taking all these pains for one of Garsykes brats, and
the brat was wet and clinging. He wearied of the lad’s
piteous crying for his mother, and cursed himself
for inhumanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They plodded on, till they came half down the slope
on his side of the stream. And now a great hubbub
sounded from Garsykes, up above them, and lanterns
were bobbing to and fro. A woman’s voice rose shrill
into the stillness of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to find my lad, or I’ll know why!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turning us out o’ doors on a wild-goose chase,”
came the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle knew the voice for Long Murgatroyd’s,
and his surly protest was taken up by one and another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lad will be at High Stellings, where you sent
him an hour since. They’d never let him run a risk
of dark o’er-taking him—open mines and what-all—so
they’re keeping him till morn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye. They’re keeping him. So let’s all get back
to thy inn, widow, and chalk up more riches for thee
on thy door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’ll be neither ale nor chalks till we’ve found
Ned. I tell you he’s lost on the moor. I know it in
my bones. And, whisht ye, what was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far-off she had heard the lad’s cry for his mammy,
though they were deaf to its meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A peewit, widow—or a curlew, maybe. One
of ours must be poaching up the fells, and started a
wild-bird up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But soon the oft-repeated cry, as it came nearer,
was plain to all, and their lanterns went bobbing up
and down, each man thinking he knew where to find
the sound, and each baffled constantly by the utter
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle made for the nearest light, and found
himself face to face with Long Murgatroyd, who gaped
at him as at a ghost and turned his lantern from the
Master to Ned’s dripping figure. Then he gave a
rough, unsteady chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s the big and little of it come to Garsykes,
neighbours. You’ve got your lad, widow, and we’ve
got summat, too, we wanted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest came crowding about Murgatroyd. The
shivering waif had leaped at a bound into his mother’s
arms, and Hardcastle found himself alone, confronting
half the men of Garsykes. With peril came a sharp,
useless sort of vision for all that made up this wild
happening. The half-circle of lanterns—the scowling
faces, part in light and part in shadow—the dumb,
do-nothing darkness of the waste lands—they were part
of a scene he looked on at, as if it were no concern of
his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That for a moment. Then he gathered his strength,
as a man might pull a bow-string tight. Most of these
folk were deep in liquor, and all were scathing with
rancour that had grown by what it fed on since the day
he paid no tribute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d best end Logie now,” said Long Murgatroyd—“Logie
and its mucky pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wolfish growl answered him, though still some
dread of Hardcastle held them. He had gone like
“a ghost-guarded man” through these last weeks of
all that Garsykes could bring to his undoing. They
were many—but they lived in a country haunted by
trolls and mine-goblins, and superstition was in their
slackened fibres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A breeze got up, quick and merry, from the top of
swart Pengables Hill. The clouds overhead were riven
apart, and the eager moon leaped through. It maddened
the Garsykes Men afresh to see Hardcastle
standing there straight to his height and waiting
silently for what might follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Widow Mathison, still clutching her boy as if she
feared to let him go again, ran suddenly in front of
Hardcastle and loosened her tongue on the rabble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s your shame, you hulking wastrels? Do
as you like to Hardcastle when you can catch him
fair—but not when he’s on this sort of errand. Ned’s
all I have, and can’t you see by the drip of him that
he’s been saved fro’ drowning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do we care?” muttered Long Murgatroyd.
“Ned’s no bairn of ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes him the likelier lad,” said the widow,
tartly. “And now you can all pack home, for I
willun’t have you touch the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appealed to singly, there were men here who would
have been pricked by shame; but they were a mob out
of hand, beast-like and robbed of what wits they
ever had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s the widow to come hectoring it over us?”
snarled one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quit talking,” shouted another. “Let drive at
Hardcastle instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master stepped quietly in front of Widow
Mathison, and they swayed and jostled, eager to attack,
but held for a moment by brutish fear of his unconcern.
In that moment the moon was snapped up by a
scudding cloud, and Hardcastle took his luck as it
came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His one hope of defence was to attack. Without a
pause he ran forward, lifting the stout stick he carried,
and smashed the lanterns one by one. Then, in the
dark of his own making, he rained blows at random into
the midst of the screaming throng.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luck could not hold for long, he knew. Already the
cloud was passing, and with clearer light would come
the end for him. But meanwhile it was good to be
alive, drawing healthy music from Garsykes skulls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the moon raced free again, it shone on a few
fallen men, on others who yelped like wolves and came
at him headlong. He glanced about him, ran nimbly
to a corner where two field-walls protected him from
rear attack, and waited for them. A man had to die
once and some day. What better end could Logie
ask of him?</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp, lurking beside the track that Hardcastle
would take from Broken Firs, wearied of his
job. It had been well enough, with Nita beside him,
to do her bidding; but the silence and the night-time
sobered him. What grudge had he, after all, against
the Master of Logie? The man had taken a random shot
at him, long ago, when he tried to rob the post-boy.
That was all in the day’s work of chance and mischance.
But what of this lying in wait, cold-blooded, for a shot
that could not miss its mark?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will was a rogue by nature—and from choice
because life offered more frolic along unlicensed roads.
Yet decency, of his own sort, travelled all roads with
him, like a faithful comrade, and the longer Hardcastle
tarried in his coming, the chillier grew this
enterprise of waiting to shoot a man as if he were a
sitting rabbit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had he heard in the Garsykes tavern? That
Nita played with men as cats play with mice—that the
way of her with them all was one and the same—and
the end a long sliding down the slope to hell. They
did not mince matters in their talk, the Garsykes Folk,
and Will o’ Wisp thought of these things now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Hardcastle did not come down the moor.
Nita had pretended to know the way he would take
to-night, the hour of his return. She was wrong, it
seemed, and the rogue felt a stealthy gladness. The
breeze sobbed and fluted through the naked spinney
where he crouched. His gun lay chilly in half-frozen
hands. Were they right when they spoke of the
little basket-weaver as of a thing accursed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was too far on the Logie-side of the moor to hear
the cries that had drawn Hardcastle from his home-track
past the spinney; and at length he gave up the
errand that had brought him here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita has hanged enough men in her garter,” he
muttered, stretching his cramped limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went down and across the pastures, leaping
a wall nimbly here and there, till he came near
Garsykes and its tumult. He saw lanterns flitting
like his namesake Will o’ Wisps about the pastures,
heard Widow Mathison swing her tongue like a flail,
and noisy voices answer to the lash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was all a mystery to him as he pressed forward,
halting only when the clouds raced over from Pengables,
hiding one step from the next. Through the
stormy murk, as he listened, came a thunder-din of
oaths, a pig-like screeching from men not used to bear
pain silently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moon ran free again, and in the sharp, cold
light he saw Hardcastle standing in the angle of two
limestone walls, with half Garsykes yammering to
be at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp had no liking for the village he had
blundered into weeks ago. There were degrees of
rascaldom, and his own feet went merrily on the margin
of such deeps as Garsykes knew. Something in Hardcastle’s
dour silence as he faced the rabble with uplifted
cudgel—some liking, inborn in him, for a man
meeting heavy odds, brought music into Will’s heart.
Moreover, he was in mood to take sides with any man
that Nita hated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this, you Garsykes louts?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned on him, ready to tear him to pieces
instead of Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s Nita’s last favourite, Lord help him,”
laughed Long Murgatroyd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He carries a fowling-piece, as it happens—and it’s
loaded—and you’re a timid folk in Garsykes, unless
all the luck’s in front of you. No, Murgatroyd, I
wouldn’t stir a foot, if I was you. You’d find it a
queer thing to be dead, with a charge of shot inside you
instead of ale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp was himself. Free of Nita, free of cold-blooded
murder up the moor, it tickled his fancy to
be master of these folk—master too, of what would
happen soon to Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took his stand on a moonlit hillock, letting the
polished barrel of his gun glint from one to another of
the mob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m judge among you,” he said, with his heedless
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you, now?” growled Murgatroyd. “A likely
man, you, to be judge of any folk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know ’em all so well, knowing myself,” chuckled
Will. “There’s my loaded gun, too—and that helps
a man to be a judge. What’s all this moil about,
widow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Widow Mathison told him, instead, her mind about
all Garsykes Men, born or unborn—with gusto, now
that Hardcastle was safe. That made Will little the
wiser till the lad broke from his mother’s grasp and
then ran back again, afraid of what he had suffered
on the fells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fell into cold water, I did,” he whimpered, “and
couldn’t get myself out. And a big man came and
tugged at me, and brought me to my mammy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp understood now; and wrath kindled
in his lazy mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d kill Hardcastle for that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” said Long Murgatroyd. “What do we care
for the widow’s brat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will o’ Wisp let his gun roam quietly from one to
another of the company. And then he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In all my days I never happened on as foul a stye
as Garsykes. Hardcastle o’ Logie saved one of yours—and
there’s something you never learned, it seems.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aye?” sneered Murgatroyd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s fairation. Be dummocked, there’s fairation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still facing them, he made his way to Hardcastle
and nodded cheerily. “I’m going Logie way myself,”
he said, “so we might as well step up together. Three’s
company sometimes, and I’m taking the gun as a
parting gift from Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle fell into step beside him, swinging his
cudgel. A pluckier mob would have rushed the pair
of them, knowing that Will’s fowling-piece could speak
only once before they were trodden down. But each
man thought of his own skin, and stood cursing
stupidly, and watched them dip over and down the
hill-crest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master and Will o’ Wisp went in silence through
the blue-grey, misty night, till Hardcastle turned
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no return to Garsykes for you, after this.
I’m in your debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay. I’d meant to go. I’m not their sort of
rogue, and never was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s supper and a bed at Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bless you, I want no thanks. If there was danger
to-night I’d come and gladly. But they’ll let you
alone for awhile. I know ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing Hardcastle could say persuaded the vagabond
to change his mind, when they came to the hill
that swept with a break-neck fall to Logie Brigg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m getting as far as I can from Nita Langrish,”
laughed Will. “She’d be weaving her spells about me
to-morrow if I stayed as near as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that he borrowed a fill of ’baccy for his pipe,
bade Hardcastle a rollicking farewell, and went his
ways into the everywhere that lay within the night-time
forest and beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle chuckled quietly. After all, few strangers
had come into Garsykes, and fared out the better
in this world’s gear. Will o’ Wisp could boast of a
good fowling-piece that was his by right of conquest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Master turned for home; and the steep of
the road brought anguish to the knee that had blundered
against a rock while he was rescuing the widow’s lad.
There had been no time to think of it till now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For very pain he was forced to rest on Logie Brigg,
and at these times life lies in wait for every man.
Pride to keep Garsykes at bay was well enough. So
was joy in the lusty strength that had cracked a crown
or two to-night. Now these were gone. He halted
on the bridge, as the pedlar and Causleen had done,
before the trees were bare—weary, heartsick and body-sick,
no flame alight on any beacon-hill ahead. It was
as if he was a child again, seeking the mother who had
slept these twenty years where the churchyard listened
to the lap of waters round its graves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under him swirled Wharfe River, playmate and
comrade and lover through the peaceful days; and
now her voice stole kindly to his ear, talking of brave
days to come. When all seemed in the losing, the
river told him, it was time for the hale-souled sort to
gather courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He limped up the hill to Logie with gaining hope, and
found it easier for a lame man to climb than it had
been to make the sharp descent that jarred every step.
For all that, he was spent and tired when he came to
his own gate—till he saw Causleen waiting for him there.
The moon showed him a face pale and eager, framed
by dark hair that was loose about it like a glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were in danger somewhere, and I could not
help you.” The Highland voice was low and troubled.
“There was a crying up the waste lands—your feet
blundered into marshes——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should you know?” he broke in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The vision came,” she went on, with great simplicity.
“I did not ask for it. It came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle’s heart beat faster, for no reason that
he knew of. Since Causleen’s first coming there had
been recurring enmity between them broken by little
rifts that let the sunlight through. He had not known
till lately how he had begun to need and seek her
comradeship. To-night he gained a deeper knowledge.
Her welcome at the gate was the one thing he had
craved, all the long way from Garsykes, and it was his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re glad I’m home again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She grew still and cold. “Glad? Yes. You
have been kind to us—two pedlars tramping to your
gate. The vision came, and I spent myself in sending
help to you across the waste—help of the spirit—and,
of course you’ll laugh at fancies—I spent myself, not
for your sake, but because you’d shown us kindness—of
your own rough sort. I wished to pay a debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Logie’s Master had known mixed weather on the
uplands, but never such a March-tide change from sun
to bitter, east-wind spite. The pedlar’s girl was
remote from him as the top of old Pengables Hill,
with its head among the driving sleet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it Nita,” he asked clumsily, “and her chatter
of the night we spent down yonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Nita.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s big, simple heart found room at last.
Through these last weeks he had been groping forward
to the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Best marry me,” he said. “I’ve wanted it,
Causleen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered nothing for awhile. Then sleet came
stinging at his face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not care for pity. Oh, you are clumsy in your
kindness! Gossip has touched us, and you stoop to
offer marriage to the beggar-maid. You are
generous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want it,” he repeated doggedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve shame enough to bear as it is. Would I add
to it? To sit each day at table, and look across at
you, and know that I owed it all to pity—would that
be happiness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to go, then glanced at his knee as if she
had not seen till now that it was bleeding through the
torn cloth of his riding-breeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You crashed against a rock,” she said softly.
“The vision showed me that, too. Can I wash and
bind it for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is of no account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that Rebecca the paragon would have
more skill? She is so wonderful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle could only wonder at her moods. She had
seemed to care that he had taken a hurt, and now
she was jealous of Rebecca. And again she had
turned and was looking at him with wide, questioning
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You asked if it was Nita. It was—but not her
gossip. Why do you lie to me, Hardcastle of Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she was gone in earnest, and Hardcastle
limped slowly up the dappled moon-dusk of the road.
Near home as he was, a late-found instinct prompted
him to hold his cudgel in readiness for whatever the
swaying shadows of the firs might hide. His left hand
swung idly at his side, till suddenly a wet snout pushed
against it and a friendly smell stole up in greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back again, are you, Storm?” said the Master,
with gruff banter. “Red from the feast, as usual?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the dog’s grey muzzle was innocent of stains.
For three days he had ravened, then had slept off the
after-sickness, had lapped greedily at every stream he
passed. No guile showed in the brown, humid eyes.
He knew nothing of repentance, or need of it. It was
just that his wander-lust was over, and somewhere
deep in his being was the knowledge that danger
threatened Logie. He was home again, and at his
post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was time you came,” said Hardcastle. “Dogs
I know, and horses I know—but women are beyond
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm had the better of him; for a half-hour later
Causleen found him in the cupboard under the stair,
and brought him food, and made much of him before
she bent above his tousled head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Storm,” she said, and cried her heart out.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap16'>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<h3>A ROPE-END AND A TREE</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle fretted during the next days,
because the hurt to his knee yielded slowly
even to Rebecca’s skill with peat and simples
and the right way of handling bandages. The fear
was on him constantly that Garsykes would hear of
his infirmity and rush to the attack before his strength
returned to face it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the pedlar, trusting to the shelter he had
promised him—and Rebecca, old in service—and
Causleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was Causleen. She was aloof and chill whenever
they met about the house. He could make nothing
of her whims. Was it his fault that he had been
asked to save her life, and was powerless to rescue her
from the whip of Nita’s tongue, except by marriage?
And marriage she disdained. He tried to reason it
all out, not understanding that reason was the last
thing concerned with what had happened to Causleen
and himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always the worst of his fretting returned to her. If
those louts from Garsykes came and he had only one
knee to serve him, what would chance? His mind
ran out to the unthinkable—for Causleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, it’s not a bit of good,” said Rebecca on one
of these afternoons, as she was bandaging his knee
afresh, “not a bit of good to go about like a man that
thinks the roof will fall because he’s got a pain in his
knee. Men are all alike, Lord help ’em—’specially
when they’re mending nicely, and ought to be giving
a thanks-be, instead of glowering like a thunderstorm.
It nags a bit, what I’m rubbing into the raw o’ your
wound? Well, there’s healing goes with nags sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know,” grumbled the Master. “I fall
lame just when Logie needs me. There’s you and
Donald——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and there’s Donald’s lass. That’s where your
shoe pinches. Times were different when I was young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tied the bandage, sewed its edges up and bit
the thread off with her strong, ancient teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Different?” asked Hardcastle, impatient of her
ministry and all things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye. We never doubted Logie’s roof was safe.
My lad doesn’t doubt it to this day. You’re young,
Master, and I’m of the elder days, and I tell you what
I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca had no more to do with bandages and healing.
She was wrapt into another world—grey and
gaunt, a prophetess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“War comes to Logie-side. The youngsters fight,
and the old see far. D’ye think I go every night and
morning to tryst my lad at the gate and get nothing for
it? He died for Logie once—and it was forty years
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jonah the brindled cat, crept into the room and
leaped to Rebecca’s shoulder. He was no hearthside
lover now, but wild and bridling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even Jonah seems to know there’s trouble coming,”
went on Rebecca. “Well, let it come, and we’ll
outface it as we’ve always done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were fewer men in Garyskes then,” said the
Master gloomily—“and more who were staunch for
Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca glanced at him, and even her free speech
was checked. She read his heart, as he could not.
The odds against him had not brought this black mood,
but fear for Causleen had. Awhile since she had been
jealous of the girl, resentful of the gaining fear that her
own reign at Logie might be ended soon. Now she
feared lest Causleen’s playing with the Master should
ruin all. It was no time “for furbelows and cantrips,”
and how could a man fight his best with half
of him wondering if his lass cared?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been fretting to give that knee o’ yours a
taste of the fresh air,” she said grudgingly. “Have
your way, then, for it’s mending fast. And, of course,
you’ll go a mile if I tell you the half is enough and to
spare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle went more than the mile. He was
unused to the prison of four walls for days on end, and
the wine of the crisp November afternoon got into his
blood with every step he took. In all the years
behind he had seldom seen Logie-land in its full breadth
and splendour as he saw it now. The striding acres,
wind-blown and lonely—the last sunset glow on old
Pengables—the sombre forest getting to its sleep—all
were like ancient friends who brought a new, swift
welcome. They might be in the losing, but they were
his as yet, and wonderfully dear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One moorland track lured him on to another, till he
reached the beech-wood that stepped down to Scawgill
Water. Life had done this and that for him, but had
not killed the boy’s romance that would linger always
in this silent place of mystery, with its grave, round-boled
trees, its red-russet drift of leaves that crinkled
to the tread. Squirrels had their tree-top nests here,
and badgers lived in the “earths” beside the stream.
A great dreamer, in spite of his hardness, the Master
still peopled the glen with all that country legend had
to tell of water-nixies, trolls and goblins. It was so
hushed a place, so instinct with underfret of the primeval
life, that no man could linger here and fail to know its
witchcraft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stifled cry sounded near at hand, and then a
groaning, low and long-drawn-out. Hardcastle,
startled out of his dreams, glanced sharply round.
Long since a wandering tinker had come to a foul
end here, and his ghost, they said, was restless time
and time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pigeons ceased their crooning in the tree-tops.
A cold and slender wind, prying to the bone, chilled
Hardcastle. Far down Logie Dale a farm-dog yapped
and barked, and a roaming fox took up the challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glanced about him, and up a clearing
of the wood saw a body swinging from a tree. All the
boy in him took fright; but the man bade him go and
see what this ghost of a suicide dead fifty years ago
was made of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gloaming filtered through leafless branches and
showed him a gaunt, six-foot body turning and twisting
on a rope. The body still groaned, but with lessening
vigour; and there was something pitiful in the feet
that trod helplessly on air, seeking firm ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle got out a knife and ripped the cord
across. The body tottered and swayed for an instant,
and afterwards it needed all his strength to check it
in its fall and lower it into the withered brackens,
Then he loosed the frowsy shirt and watched the dull
purple steal from the man’s face, giving way to a pallor
as of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slow return of life was terrible to be alone with,
and Hardcastle welcomed the plea for water that came
by and by. The stream lay below them, and he had
no vessel of any kind; so he shouldered the half-lifeless
body, carried it to the bank and ladled water in
his palms as best he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s better,” gurgled the man, when at last his
choking throat contrived to swallow a few drops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farm-dog and the yapping fox had roused every
house about the fells by now. From Pengables to
Crake Beacon, dogs gave tongue, loud across the still
night-air. And close at hand, in answer, came a
scampering of wild things through the undergrowth.
Field voles twittered, and overhead the flitter-mice
cried thinly as they vanned to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of this stealthy terror of the woodland
folk, the man propped against the stream’s bank began
to drink greedily and to good purpose, till Hardcastle
denied him more. Then they two looked at each
other, in the light of a moon that shone wanly through
the naked tree-tops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s you, Hardcastle o’ Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Long Murgatroyd—and the devil of a time
you’ve given me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good news.” The man’s slow-witted hatred,
nursed in health, leaped out in this hour of weakness
and release from death; “but it’s naught to what’s
waiting for you up at Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A madness came on Hardcastle. The sweat of
trouble he had given this lout, dangling between earth
and sky awhile since, asked for a word or two in
another key. His hands were itching for the throat
that he had saved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were minded to spare the hangman trouble
later on,” he said at last, “and so am I. But I’ll
leave you to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd began to laugh, and could not check
himself for awhile. Then he put a hand to his throat,
and laughed again, as a dotard might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came near to hanging myself in Nita’s garter,
as that terrible pranksome fellow, Will o’ Wisp, would
say. And so did you, Hardcastle. What could I
do but laugh? We might have been swinging together—me
on one tree, and Logie’s high-almighty on its
neighbour. We’d have made a bonnie picture—with
Nita coming to look on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The farm-dogs yelped and barked across the wastes.
Fear gained on the little people of the wood. The
breeze sobbed and whimpered, and would not be still.
And Hardcastle feared greatly, too—lest he could keep
his hands no longer from Long Murgatroyd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fit to be left, if I take your rope home with
me?” he snapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd was recovering fast. “You needn’t
take it. She maddened me so with her come-and-kiss,
and her stand you off, and all the sick damnation of
it, that I fancied a rope’s end more than Nita. That’s
gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone, has it?” asked Hardcastle, with a sick
kind of wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye. I’ll get my arms about her, soon or late.
I promised her no less. So you run home to Logie,
if there’s any Logie standing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s stood against the Garsykes swine for years
out of mind. I’m not for hurrying, Murgatroyd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Deep, sullen hatred showed in the man’s face,
mottled with returning life. To Hardcastle it was as
if he looked down into the pit of hell, seeing a lost man
who would not be saved at any cost of trouble from
helping hands above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita wanted me to go with them to-night,” said
Murgatroyd; “but I told her I’d rather hang myself
in a wood than do her bidding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man fell into cackling laughter again, then
shivered as memory of the rope returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d have been a bonnie couple, swinging side
by side; but ’twas not to be, it seems.”</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle left him there, and swung up the fields
to Logie. His pace quickened with every stride, for
Murgatroyd’s tale of peril to the house had found its
mark. If it were true that an attack was planned,
he might already be too late; and he thought ceaselessly
of his home—and of Causleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he topped the rise that looked down on Logie,
he glanced eagerly up-dale. Prepared to see flames
leaping high into the dusk, he saw only a steady
lamplight glow that shone from the window over the
porch—Causleen’s window—and instead of men’s
frenzied shouts he heard only a farm-lad’s song as he
went about the business of the mistals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relief was so quick, so urgent, that a sudden
“God be thanked” escaped him. Murgatroyd had
lied. He should have known as much, and saved
himself the sick suspense of his journey up the fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For why should God specially be thanked?”
asked a quiet voice at his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant the shepherd, a silent man in all his ways,
had come noiselessly to the Master’s side, and was
tugging at his wispy beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound you, Stephen, you startled me. They
said the Garsykes Men had come to Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they haven’t, to all appearance; but they
come to my sheepfold as if there was no law in the land.
I stepped down to talk about it with you, Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ewes must take their chance, as we all do
these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, they mean little to you, and always did. Time
was when you sheltered Storm, though he was a red-jawed
outlaw dog. Well, I got Storm at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle found the grim humour that gave salt
and savour to these harsh days. “You got Storm,
poor beast,” he said, thinking of the cupboard under
the stair at Logie—thinking, too, of Causleen and her
way with the backslider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll trouble me no more—but durned if these
Garsykes Men aren’t worse than a kennel-full of such
as Storm. They grow outrageous—fair outrageous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master was glad of the chance given him to
speak his mind. “There are six of us leal to the old
house, Stephen. The rest are paying tribute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn ’em, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get away before Logie goes. I brought you into
this, thinking we’d win through. There’s no need for
you to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Brant—“except that we’re twin and
marrow in our love o’ Logie. Where you bide, I
bide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glanced over to the light that shone from
Causleen’s window. All was in the losing, and his
wits were keen to save her from the last, foul uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Could we get the pedlar and his girl to your hut
on the moor? It’s cold up yonder at this time o’
year, but there are worse things than cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could. The bracken-sledge would bump old
Donald a bit by the way, but we’d pad him well with
hay-trusses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have the sledge out to-morrow, with the old
grey horse to draw it. He’s only eating his head off
in the stable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so fast, Master,” put in Brant dryly.
“That hut o’ mine is well enough for a rough
shepherd, but I’ll fettle it up before a maid can pretend
to be suited with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no time to ask whether the maid’s pleased or
not,” snapped the other. “You know what may
happen any moment if she stays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant was silent as they crossed the last pasture-field.
He knew many things—not least of them the
reason that made Hardcastle gloomy and prone to
caution nowadays. It would be better for them all
if Causleen were out of Garsykes’ reach, and the Master’s
mind relieved of the sapping dread lest hurt should
come to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be ready,” he said, opening the back-gate of
Logie for Hardcastle to pass through. “Then,
after we’re free of what you might call encumbrances,
we’ll set about putting the fear of hell into the Lost
Folk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle regained his old self at a bound, for no
reason that he guessed. “What’s in that feud-sick
mind of yours, Brant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To gather my stolen ewes from Garsykes. Six
of us are staunch, and six have dogs to round ’em up
and back to Logie. We’ve fowling-pieces, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But cannot use them, Brant. You should know
that I’m a magistrate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Humour answered veiled humour. “To be sure
we can’t—save for killing vermin. That’s allowed by
law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great burden had slipped from the Master’s
shoulders. He was free somehow, to carry a careless
heart and fight Logie to the last edge of what might
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, after we’ve got the pedlar safe up-moor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sooner the better. Who told you they were
coming against Logie to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long Murgatroyd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d be a liar if he stood on the brink o’ Kingdom
Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where he did stand—dangled, I should
say—when I found him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aye?” asked Brant, with slow curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are things men don’t think of twice, if they
can help it. Come indoors, and tell Rebecca that
winds are dry and thirsty on the heights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are,” said the shepherd, with conviction,
“and from this to Hawes Water there’s no ale as ripe
as Logie’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They parted in the stable-yard, and Hardcastle,
coming to the grey, moonlit front of the house, glanced
at the room over the porch. The light still shone from
it, and Causleen, kneeling on the window-seat, looked
down at him. The lamp-glow behind her ran out to
meet the silver-gold, soft moonlight. And both were
tender with her beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ve waited for you,” she said, her voice soft
as one of her own Highland burns in summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great joy blazed up in Hardcastle, as if boyhood
found its spring again. “You’ve waited?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Rebecca is beyond herself with grief. She
sees you lying dead somewhere on the fells, and sits
and croons, saying she ought never to have let you out
of her sight—with your wounded knee, and all the mad
wolves hunting you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them hunt,” said Hardcastle, his dreams
shattered suddenly by her chill laugh of contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will comfort Rebecca, while you go to father. He
has been asking for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that mockery, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of it is mockery. And Rebecca need not
have feared. There’s a mad wolf glaring up at me—bigger
than any of the Garsykes breed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle conquered his gusty rage. She was a
woman, and his guest. If the new dreams had to go—well,
the old ones had gone, and soon Logie would be
ended, too. Nothing mattered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donald asks for me?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said it—and we of the Highlands do not lie, as
you of Logie do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master limped into his own house, forgetting
the fret of the knee that had broken Rebecca’s bandages
by now. A yelp of welcome sounded the moment
he set foot indoors, and Storm left his hiding-place
and pressed close against him, clamoring for
attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle held up a warning hand. “Kennel,
lad. There’s Brant in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm’s tail fell limp. His whole body seemed to
shrink and lessen as he crept back to the cupboard.
He had learned that Brant was a word of evil meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor devil,” muttered Hardcastle, “there’s not
much left for him in life, though he saved three of us.
Brant or another will get him soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the room where Donald lay on the
settle, his body tethered by weakness, but his eyes
bright and eager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted you,” said the pedlar. “Sit ye down in
the chair here, and I’ll let some of my long thoughts
out. They burden me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His glance roved from Hardcastle to the pike that
hung above the mantel, and back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not grudge you that any longer,” he went on.
“They tell me of your stand against the Lost Folk,
and I care for a man who can make music out of odds.
I would that, here in Yorkshire, you had the pipes to
hearten you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mind wandered to the glens of home, to unforgotten
pibrochs and his long fight with poverty—wandered
to the gorsy braes that he had roamed with
Causleen’s mother. Then he spoke again, smiling
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one is chained as I am, there is nothing to
be done, except grow wise. If a man can fight one
sort of honest battle, he can fight all. I wanted you
to know that—that your guests have not turned
vagabonds for choice, or for lack of struggle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, wrenched out of old ruts by war and
heartache, found a fine simplicity. He understood
all that Donald left unsaid, the grace and manliness
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My guests are very welcome,” he said, diffident and
gruff. “They should know as much by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have fought, Causleen and I. There were no
pipes with us, no press of foemen waiting for attack.
There was only poverty—a dumb enemy, cold and
crafty, that lay in wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Donald’s glance wandered to the Flodden
pike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be gentle with an old man who sees before and
after, and must ease his mind. There are cairns in
my country, reared to Hielandmen who died with the
broadsword in their hands. There’s not one to speak
of those who fought poverty, the hardest foe of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then his restless mind went wandering down the
centuries. He told of Macbeth and Duncan—of
Glencoe and its narrow shambles—of Prestonpans and
Derby Town and red Culloden Moor—as of staunch,
forthright matters he had shared. And, whether he
lived or died in far-off tumults, there was constantly
the joy of well-worth-while, the thud of blows, the
heartening wonder of the pipes, playing men up the
further hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only when he came to the tale of his journey
from the Highlands that the song went out of his voice,
the light from his eyes. Hardcastle grew ashamed of
his own wealth and ease, as he listened to the slow
recountal of trinkets sold here, to earn a bed for the
night—of fortunes told in an alien country to win the
price of a wayside meal. The tale was so simply told
that he, too, felt footsore and heartsore as he listened.
Donald roused himself at last from his journeys down
the years. The quiet, beguiling smile crept once more
across the grey creases of his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I wearied you with my chatter—as I tire
you because I’m so long in dying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall get you strong again——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” broke in Donald. “Something tells me
the end is even nearer than you think—a tame
end to a life that has dreamed so much of ancient
battles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle humoured his mood, garrulous but
constantly returning to the one clouded purpose.
For pride’s sake he needed to explain how Causleen
and he came to be travelling the roads, and presently
his mind grew clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had ever been Stuart men in the old days—losing,
and hoping, and fighting—till little was left
me when my time came to be laird in the dreadful days
of honour and peace. That little went, and Causleen
had to make her choice. There was a rich wooer came.
A great name he had, and nothing against him but the
one thing that damned all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Donald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not understand. How should you?
The Stuarts were discrowned and out of mind long
since, you’d say; but in the Highlands they can never
be discrowned. And the wooer who came was of a
clan that had sold the old allegiance for gold—just
for guinea-pieces to jangle in a purse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire of youth kindled in Donald’s voice. Consuming
wrath was in his eyes. And Hardcastle understood
better than the pedlar guessed; for Logie
moorlands knew the way of staunchness to their own
allegiance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left the choice to Causleen, though I’d rather have
seen the child in her shroud than linked to him. ‘He
can save the house for us with his gold,’ I said, to prove
her. And, ‘He cannot,’ said she, ‘for there’s Stuart
blood on it. A hundred years is not enough to cleanse
it.’ So we took the roads together, she and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes closed for awhile. One purpose was
achieved; but another clamoured for fulfilment, and
he had little time to spare. He was alert again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She took the roads as bravely as she took her
choice—but soon she will be travelling alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was question in the pedlar’s glance—a pleading
that was command almost. And out of doors a breeze
plucked and rattled at the windows, as if to deepen
fear of what the lone highways had in store for Causleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle watched the lamplight flicker in the
draught, looked on the old, familiar furnishings with
new vision—the bell-mouthed blunder-busses of his
father’s time, the pewter polished to dim lustre by
what was known to Rebecca as “elbow grease”—the
pike that had given every son of Logie pause when he
was minded to be less than the men who marched to
Flodden long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew what Donald hoped for, and with wry
humour he recalled the way of Causleen since he saved
her from the snow—her avoidance of him, or mockery
such as she had showered on him from her window
when he came by to-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would have me guard her? Nothing but
marriage could give me that right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have watched you, and the laid-by folk see much.
It seemed that you cared, and hope grew apace. That
is why I tell you what her proper station is. My girl
would not shame Logie’s pride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something wistful in the pedlar’s eagerness,
his dignity. He longed for Causleen’s safety,
but would not cringe for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will have none of me, Donald—so how can
I ease your mind? I’ll ask no woman twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great joy shone in the pedlar’s face. He had had
no inkling, till now, that Hardcastle had forestalled
his keen desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Second thoughts are sometimes best—especially
a maid’s. She thought you offered marriage out of
pity, maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I could not persuade her from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will,” said Donald softly, and drew a long
breath of thankfulness, and dozed awhile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he roused himself, his hold on this world
seemed gone. He looked out before him as if no
house-walls and no leagues of foreign country hid the
wild glens of Inverness. He was home again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had two dreams,” he said, his voice clear and
lusty. “One was to know Causleen safe, and that comes
true. The other was a sick man’s fancy. I dreamed”—he
tried to lift himself, and failed—“dreamed
that I died a warrior, instead of Pedlar Donald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that his eyes closed, and Rebecca, coming
to see how it went with him, stood beside the settle,
her grim face softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sleeps like a babby, poor soul—and it would be as
well if he died in it, instead of living to be bumped on a
bracken-sledge to-morrow. Brant sits snug by my
hearth, and tells me you’re for turning the old man
out o’ doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Garsykes Men are coming. He’s safer up
the moor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His brat is safer, you mean. Why don’t you want
to tuck me, too, on the sledge, if Logie is no place for
women? D’ye think that, because I’ve a face like
a hatchet, to scare men with, I’ve a heart after the
same pattern? Ask the lad that keeps tryst with
me at the gate, every night and all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lowered the lamp, took another look at Donald
as if he were an ailing first-born of her own, and together
they went out into the draughty hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm yapped and whimpered from his cupboard,
and Hardcastle went in to quiet him, thinking only of
the dog’s peril, not of Logie’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s Brant near by,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm would not be satisfied. He bared his teeth
and growled till Hardcastle cuffed him. Then the
sheep-slayer shivered and lay down—but not for fear
of Brant—and whined, as the rising breeze about the
house sobbed from the lost Garsykes lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Hardcastle had fastened him in, with a biscuit
or two for company, he went with Rebecca to the
kitchen. They found Brant sitting by the hearth, a
stoup of ale beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting mellow, Stephen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mellowish, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s naught else to do these days, while the
waiting-time is on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He talks of sleeping here to-night,” said Rebecca,
harking back to her grievance, “says he wants to be
ready for the sledge-journey you’ve planned. If
you want to kill poor Donald outright—well, bump
him to his death on the bracken-track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, a little afraid of his henchwoman in
times of ease, was the master now. “War has come.
Will you put that into your mind once for all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not likely to forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re coming one day to fire Logie. D’ye
think we want to be crippled by thought of Donald,
lying helpless? If he had his choice, would he be
burned in his bed—or risk death on the bracken road,
with God’s winds about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s winds blow snell and cruel these days
Indoors or out, there’s little to choose, and men like
Brant come trapesing in to beg a night’s lodging. He’s
killed Storm, he tells us, and should be content with
that, without adding murder of poor Donald to his
Judgment tally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Killing of Storm won’t worrit me, when my time
comes,” chuckled Brant. “There’ll be a few score
ewes to back me up—ewes that might have gone into
his jaws if it hadn’t been for a lucky shot o’ mine.
As for Donald, I’m with the Master. He’s a better
chance on the uplands than tied to his bed at Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, talk at me, now you’re two to one. Beat an
old woman down. But when you’ve killed a lone
pedlar—one that’s shared Logie’s salt—don’t run
to my apron for comfort. I’ll give you none.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shouldn’t look for it,” said the Master dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca, taut as a bow-string, was at war with herself
and every living thing about her, because peril
did not come. The lad who had trysted her at the
gate these forty years, had told her yesterday of havoc
brewing up. And instead there was a wet breeze
sobbing round the house, and Brant with the ale-froth
about his stubbly beard and Hardcastle, dour and tall
and thinking of Causleen. She knew that he was
thinking of her, and heard children, of his getting,
shout in play. Forlorn, alone and jealous, she sought
for a grievance, and found it speedily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your knee’s dripping, Master, and so much for
my bandages. A careless man at all times, you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to the cupboard near the hearth, and got
out a store of lint, and herbs that staunched the
bleeding. The Master was hers for a little while,
before Causleen stole him from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It hurts, as I rub it in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like the devil, Rebecca. But have your way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bark sounded down the gusty corridor, and Brant
cocked a hairy ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Storm wasn’t dead, I’d have sworn I heard him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His ghost barked,” said Rebecca. “No wonder
he’s haunting you from this to the end of all. Are
you sure you killed him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, I’m sure of that. And, as for his ghost, it
needn’t trouble me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca finished her task, and gave the bandage a
rough, ill-tempered pat. “There! If fire and slaughter’s
coming, it’s as well to have two legs to stand on instead
of one. Men are feckless, left to themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now a silence crept about the house, and into
the hearts of these three. They longed for the wind
to rattle at the casements; but it, too, had fallen
dumb. Logie was a house aware—its every stone and
rafter-beam—of a peril sinister and urgent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brindled cat, catching the stealthy unrest of
the house, had gone to Storm for comfort, only to
find his ancient ally prisoned for the night. He
wandered back to the kitchen now, and sprang to the
table. His eyes were big, his fur stiff and ruffled, as
if he waited for rats to come to Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca glanced at him. “You, Jonah? Drat
you for another male that’s stepped into my kitchen,
looking warlike—and finding no sort of battle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swept him from the table, with a sudden gust
of spite, and the cat, gathering himself up, showed
teeth and claws and spat at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Rebecca laughed and cried, and gathered the
great cat into her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean it, Jonah—but my heart’s just
breaking with the trouble of it all.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap17'>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<h3>FLAME</h3>

<p class='pindent'>That night they waited in Garsykes village
till the moon dipped over Scummer Rigg
and grey-black gloom shrouded heath and
pasture-land. Then every man who had strength to
carry a burden reached out for his well-filled sack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd came up the hill with his shammocky
stride just as they were shouldering the sacks.
He stood awhile in the lamp-glow streaming from the
tavern windows, and they drew away from him as if
he had the plague. There was something unearthly
in his white, drawn face, in the laugh that broke his
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I’m in time, after all? It’s better pastime,
this, than hanging yourself in Nita’s garter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man still felt raw of a hempen cord about his
neck—the cord that Hardcastle had loosed not long
ago. Yet he laughed again, as he glanced from one
to another. Once he had lain in wait for Hardcastle,
and twice the Master had given him his life. The
memory bit and rankled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Logie flares red as hell to-night,” he said. “Let’s
make a start!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out into a dark that could be felt, soon
as the inn’s friendly gleam was left behind. It reared
itself against them like a wall, so that they feared
almost to break themselves against it. Then, as their
eyes grew used to it a little, they picked their way
across lean fields, over marshes yielding to the tread,
through woods of pine and larch whose rustling
blackness put slack fear into their limbs. But they
dreaded more the open highway that gave them a
ready way to Logie. Deep in the bones and fibre
of the Lost Folk lurked distrust of roads where honest
men might be encountered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was when they came to Logie Brigg that superstition
gathered thick about them. They huddled
together, a lack-luster mob, on their side of the crossing.
It was a saying centuries old in Garsykes that
luck never came of hindering a Hardcastle. They
might rob or take tribute of Logie’s tenants, but
must not touch its master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bleating ewes, are you?” snarled Murgatroyd.
“There’s all us—and up yonder only Hardcastle and
two women, and an aged man who may be quick or
stiff by now. And you bleat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A rough voice answered him through the murk of
the windy night, over the song of Wharfe River as
she raced below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was you brought the trouble to Garsykes,
when you were fool enough to wait for Hardcastle
at the pinfold. There’s been naught but ill-luck
since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The jostling mob, glad of a scapegoat for its panic,
turned on Murgatroyd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, be you first to cross the bridge—if you dare,
mad Murgatroyd!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His madness came on him in earnest. The broken
years of his slavery to Nita, came to a head. Better
any happening up at Logie than Nita’s laughter if
they left the house standing and came back with the
tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He forced his way through the press. Shammocky
no longer, but grim and straight and broad he led his
Legion of the Lost between the grey, narrow walls of
Logie Brigg. And all men followed him, afraid of the
gaunt figure striding through the gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to the gate of Logie, where Donald had
found their token in the autumn days. Above them
the house lay dark and hushed. Starlings cheeped
and scolded in the ivied wall, but no other challenge
answered their intrusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd gave a low chuckle—bleak and terrible
as when he had jested after looking over the brink of
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re not expected, though I blabbed to Hardcastle.
He fancied, seemingly, that a liar never can
speak truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with savage zest, he planned the night-surprise,
giving them no time for a second panic. He
would lead one half to the main door, while the rest
stole through the stable-yard and attacked the kitchen-entry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sharp and ready does it, and any man would be
a fool to fall soft now. He’d have Long Murgatroyd
to reckon with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Overwhelming weight of numbers was with them.
So was the slumber of a house that did not look for
them to-night. But Murgatroyd’s gruff threat was
the steadying note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those chosen for the rear attack crept pad-footed
round the yard, and piled their sacks against the
kitchen door with frantic haste till the woodwork
was hidden by a bulging load of fuel. They littered
the stone porch with what bags were left, and fired
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blaze was so fierce and instant that they leaped
back into the cool dark of the night, and waited for
those in Logie to be burned in their beds, or to come
through the flames for what waited them. And the
first that those within-doors heard of trouble was
Storm’s frenzied barking as he hurled himself against
his cupboard-door, to break it through for Logie’s sake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master lay for a moment between sleep and
waking. One window of his room opened on the
stable-yard, and below he heard the restless tread of
feet, the crackling of flame. Grey, pungent smoke
was drifting in already across his bed, and he sprang
up with an odd sense of readiness—and of relief.
What they had waited for was here at last, to be met
and grappled with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant, too, had heard the uproar, and they met at
the stairway head and ran down together to the
kitchen. Hardcastle was in shirt and breeches,
donned hastily, and the shepherd made a queer figure,
his beard splayed above the top of a woollen nightshirt
that reached to his unlaced boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They glanced at each other in the light of the
smouldering kitchen-fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve a fowling-piece, Master?” murmured
Brant. “Better have chosen a likelier gun. From
what I’d heard, I fancied they were coming—this
night or the next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off to listen to the roar of flame outside,
to watch the door blister and gape open in wide rents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I borrowed a blunderbuss before I got up to bed,”
he went on, in the same low voice, “and loaded it.
It would make you laugh to know what I crammed
into its muzzle—pebbles and rusty nails, and all
kinds of winsome odds and ends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door they were watching gaped wider, and
great joy came to them, born of the house they loved.
Without were fire and all the scum of Garsykes.
Within were two leal men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The odds are with us, Stephen,” said Hardcastle,
breaking a silence that seemed long. “When the door’s
down, they’ll be in the glare, and we in darkness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re getting quick at the uptake,” grunted
Brant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light step sounded close behind them, and Causleen
stood there, her hair rippling in a dusky cloud
about her night-gear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, go back, child,” said the Master. “There’s
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve faced many kinds. Shall I tell you why I
stay, Hardcastle of Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was daunted by her courage, by the smouldering
anger in her face. Causleen did not seem to hear
Brant, or gaping door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stay to see if you’re better at the fighting than
the wooing. A laggard in one is a laggard at both,
they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no time for warfare of the tongue, and Hardcastle
turned sharply to carry her out of harm’s way.
He turned again, for the thick, nail-studded door had
crashed inward with a swirl of flame and dancing
faggot-embers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing chanced for awhile save fire that drove
him back, and stench of tar and resin. Storm’s
barking rang like a wolf-cry through the house, till
suddenly it ceased, and Rebecca stood among them,
the dog bristling by her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s a queer upset in my kitchen,” she said,
glancing from the blazing doorway to the men’s faces.
“I wakened late, I own, but I’d sense to go and loose
Storm first. He might have been burned alive, poor
lamb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brant and the sheep-slayer eyed each other with
slow wonder, as folk who had not looked for the meeting
and did not relish it. Then, with peril waiting
close at hand for both, the shepherd’s full-fed wrath
blazed out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shot you, Storm. I shot you, d’ye hear, for
killing ewes of mine. And you’re alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm left Rebecca and showed bared teeth to
Brant. He was no outlaw here at Logie, but ripe
and ready for what was coming to the house he
guarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much for you, Brant,” said Rebecca, with a
cackle of wild laughter. “A word from the Master,
and he’ll have his jaws in your lean throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flames of the blazing door were lessening now,
for kitchen and porch alike were floored with stone
and offered no fresh fuel; and the moment came that
Hardcastle had looked for. The Garsykes Men,
when no uproar sounded from within—though the
besieged should be between two fires by now—grew
restless and afraid of some ambush waiting in the
dark of the stable-yard. A common impulse swayed
them to dash over the live embers into the house before
the first shock of surprise was over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they came into the ruddy murk of the porch,
Hardcastle aimed point-blank at them. A wild-beast
howl followed from men not used to bearing pain.
Then the porch was empty, save for the foremost of
the Garsykes Folk, whose legs were full of shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside there was a rough stampede of men who
fought each other in their panic to get out of gun-reach.
And Brant the shepherd suddenly went mad
with the blood-lust. Robbed of his chance to fire a
shot, he pushed Hardcastle aside, trod over the fallen
body and ran out with a grim oath in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was black, impenetrable. Sight aided
him nothing, but hearing did. On the high uplands
Brant had learned to see with his ears when need
pressed. The fleeing mob, not far down the road as
yet, was making noise enough to rouse dead men on
their gibbets, and Brant’s blunderbuss bellowed like
a stag gone mad at rutting-time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A livid shriek of anguish followed, and those in
Logie’s kitchen waited for Brant to return in triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark to them,” said Rebecca, rubbing her hands
together. “They came to Logie, as my lad told me
at the gate—and they go as he fore-warned me. By
the marrow, how they squeal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen thought of her father. He had been asleep
when she glanced in on her way to the kitchen; but
the uproar must have roused him, and it was terrible
to picture him lying there, alone and helpless, waiting
for he knew not what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master’s thoughts were with his shepherd, who
did not return. “Brant’s long in coming,” he muttered
restlessly, and had taken a step toward the porch
when he halted, checked by the strangest tumult that
had come to Logie on this night of crashing din.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard a bellow of mingled rage and fear, and knew
the voice for Long Murgatroyd’s. He heard, too,
the muffled oaths of other men. He sprang to Causleen’s
side and put her behind him; and now the sharp
stench of fire wisped and eddied down the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back,” he muttered, hearing her steps close
following his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would not, and they ran down the long corridor
together till they reached the open door of the room
where Donald lay. And on the threshold they stood
as in a nightmare, aghast at what they saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd and a press of Garsykes Men were
in the room, their faces lit by a fire they had piled in
the middle of it. The lamp-glow, stealing through the
room where Donald slept, had shown them an easier
way of entry than burning down the main door. They
had crashed through the window, tossed down their
sacks pell-mell and lit them. If they had seen the
sleeping man, they took him for dead or helpless and
had not heeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much was plain to Causleen and Hardcastle,
looking on with the nightmare grip about them still.
But the pedlar slept no longer. He was awake
and on his feet. His face caught the fireglow as
wrinkled parchment might—little lines of crimson
criss-crossing its ancient pallor—but the body they
had thought chained was alert and strong, willowy
with youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald had gone to sleep content. His girl would
be safe in Hardcastle’s hands, and he was free to let
dreams take him down the roads of old romance,
when those of his race plied claymores and heard the
battle-din. He woke to see an ill-kempt company
lighting a fire at the far end of the room; and suddenly
life raced into his palsied limbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peril to Logie was mingled in his thoughts with
far-off combats up the glens at home. He stood there,
supple and thin and dominant, gathering the dreams
come true at last. And the Garsykes mob gaped at
this dead man who faced them without any weapon
but his consuming joy in battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd was twitching from one foot to
the other. The men behind him were bound as by a
spell. So was Hardcastle, who was aware of deeper
things than he had known till now. The Garsykes
Folk saw only Donald. That was plain, and the pedlar
must have his will of this last moment, till there was
need to intervene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donald glanced about, as if in search of something
that had shared his tedious days in this same room.
And still Murgatroyd and those behind were held in
thrall. The fire they had kindled blazed and smoked
by turns in the sleepy draught, till Murgatroyd kicked
it into flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wood’s wet,” he muttered, “and be damned
to the fools that gathered it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, wet with blood,” shrilled Donald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that, strength came to him. His glance,
roving again about the walls, found the thing he
sought. With speed incredible he leaped to get the
pike into his hands—the pike that had gone to Flodden
and returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He swung it gently to and fro for one swift moment,
as if he doubted which of its three blades to ply. Then,
with a Gaelic battle-shout, he leaped forward, through
and over the fire’s reek, whirling the axe-edge high
above his old, grey head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd got his skull away from the blow;
but the axe clove his shoulder till it gritted on the
bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m done, lads,” he growled, swaying to his fall.
“Get about this madman risen from the dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No voice answered him. The Garsykes Men had
gone the way they came taking still dread for company.
Alone with one who whirled his axe to strike
again, Murgatroyd gathered what strength was left
him, and ran screaming out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great light shone in Donald’s face. There was
strength in his body still, and a pibroch in his soul;
and, when Causleen ran to him across the dwindling
fire, he turned happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was so they fought in the old days gone. I’m
glad you saw me make an end that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He toyed with the pike lovingly. He praised
Logie for keeping its edges grouted and sharp through
the centuries for this night’s work of his. Then his
strength fell away, a borrowed joy. The pike dropped
from his grasp, clattering into the embers that Hardcastle
was stamping out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your hands, child,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She guided him to the long-settle that had been his
bed for many weary days, and her tears rained on the
blankets she gathered round the motionless body.
Donald opened his eyes once—glad, tender eyes, at
peace with this world and the next—and he found voice,
as he had got strength awhile since to lift the pike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Causleen, little Evening Star, you’ve lit the roads
for me. And now—dear God, there’s sunrise on the
hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedlar lay quiet awhile. All that was of this
world clamoured round him. He was saying good-bye
to the broken roads he loved. There would be no
to-morrows, with curlews wailing over summer hills
and dusk cradling in purple hollows of the moor—no
journeys on blistered feet through the tang of winter
gales. He ached for the northland he must leave,
and his spirit shrank from the last Crossing because
the world was full of lovesome things. Surely he
would see once again the shimmer of buttercups
glowing like grace of old allegiance across the ripening
meadows, would hear the storm-cock pipe defiance
to the gale. Just once again he must smell, too, the
reek of clover-hay as it came home on creaking wagons
between the briar-rose banks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It grows dark,” he murmured suddenly. “And
now the light shines through—and, child, there’s your
mother beckoning from the braes. She’s just as young
and bonnie—as bonnie——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so the warrior died, and Hardcastle stood with
bowed head till Causleen’s first storm of grief was
ended. A strange gentleness came to him, a softening
of the ice-cold years, as he covered Donald’s face and
drew the girl away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood facing each other in the dim lamplight.
A chill breeze blew through the broken casement,
tossing to and fro the reek of the stamped-out fire.
On the floor the pike lay in a little pool of crimson,
darkening fast. Yet nothing prevailed against the
austere and tranquil presence that filled this room of
death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Causleen,” he said, by and by, “you need not be
lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was feeling like a child lost in mid-winter moors.
No words could have reached her heart as his simple,
“you need not be lonely,” did. He was changed,
as she was, by this alchemy of death, into finer metal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, longing to believe in him, she took a step away.
“It is not the time or place to—to doubt you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the place to tell me why you doubt.” His
glance went to the death-bed. “Could I be false,
with your father lying there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could not—no—and yet it seems so mean a
thing to talk of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It divides us, and <span class='it'>he</span> did not want that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ashamed either way,” she said, her brave
eyes meeting his—“of you, or of myself for doubting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little by little he drew the tale from her. She had
come to the wood between Logie and the slope to
Wharfe River, weeks ago, and seen him with Nita’s
arms stretched out to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle understood now all that had baffled
him these late days. He recalled each detail of that
half-forgotten scene—Nita’s alluring eagerness, the
sharp crack of a twig, his glance backward to learn if
one of the Lost Folk was stealing on him from behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw us there,” he said, “and she was an
old love of mine. What else could you have
thought?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His quietness seemed to rebuke her. All these weeks
she had been the silent accuser, he the shameless culprit.
Was he a liar through and through, under his mask
of gruff honesty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shared the woodmen’s hut for a night,” he
went on, “and afterwards there was trouble. I asked
to clear that for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From pity.” It was her turn now to glance at
the silent figure on the settle. “We never cared for
charity, he and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not offer charity,” he said, direct and forthright.
“While I was persuading you to that, Nita
wove her devilry into it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What devilry?” she asked, her eyes grave and
questioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced from the shattered casement to Donald’s
death-bed, and his face hardened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She offered me escape from what has come to
Logie—and I would not take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen’s heart was free at last, as she watched
this man whom she had flouted. He showed greater
than his height in the dim lamp-glow that made
flickering lights and shadows through the room. His
voice though hushed in deference to what lay yonder,
was vibrant in its simple candour. He loved her—loved
her for herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gusty weariness came about her, a need to lean
on the man who had caused her sleepless nights and
tears as salt as the nether brine-pits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid—till now,” she whispered, and put
her hands into his as if she gave a kingdom.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap18'>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<h3>THE RESTLESS DAWN</h3>

<p class='pindent'>As they stood there, a stifled bark sounded from
the doorway. Storm, his grizzled hide quivering
with eagerness, came sidling in. Fire and gunshot
and the night’s swift happenings had opened the
windows through which dogs and horses see things
hidden from most men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that death was in the room, and cringed
his way to Donald’s side. He crouched for a while,
his head on the still body, and whimpered like a child;
for the pedlar and he had shared many an hour of
friendship when life was wrong with both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the sheep-slayer rose and shook himself. There
was no cringeing now, no sorrow. Self-reliant, strong
of body and of courage, he came to Hardcastle, who
knew less than he what was soon to happen on Logie-side.
He looked at the Master with brown, candid
eyes—a lingering glance of sheer affection—and put
two hairy paws on his shoulders while he licked his
face. And afterwards he said good-bye to Causleen,
and turned once at the broken casement before passing
out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor devil,” muttered Hardcastle. “I’d whistle
him back, if Brant was not about the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brant would not shoot him, after all we’ve shared
with Storm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In cold blood. Logie might go, and all of us, if
Stephen’s ewes were safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a hard country,” said Causleen, clinging to
his sleeve with sharpening dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Rebecca came running to the door, and
stood like one turned to stone when she saw these two
together. The kingdom of her days at Logie was
ended. That was plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked the Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naught that matters now; but, for my part, I’d
have chosen a likelier time for sweethearting. My
kitchen asking a week o’ days to redd it up again—fire
and brimstone on this side o’ the house—and you
two fancying you’re cushat-doves high up in a mating
tree. I’ve no patience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” asked Hardcastle again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naught that would trouble you if I told it. You’re
past caring how an old woman fares, though she’s
skin and bone for your sake—wearing her life out, cooking
and scrubbing. And, ‘What is it?’ asks the
Master. It’s this, if you must know. Brant’s not
come back, and I’m tired of guarding my kitchen with
a rolling-pin against yond lean swine from Garsykes.
If Brant’s gone, some o’ them are lurking in the stable-yard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle put Causleen from him gently. The new
peril was harsh enough, but he was quick these days
to face unexpected happenings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay here, child,” he said sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stayed for one snatched moment to stoop above
her father and give his soul a God-speed. Then she
followed Hardcastle, and he felt a hand steal into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, get back, child,” he said. “There’s trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So my place is with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would not be denied; and when they came into
the kitchen, Brant the shepherd was crossing the
doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spared us the need to go in search of you, have you,
Stephen?” snapped Rebecca. “You look moiled,
and fuzzy in your wits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’d look,” grumbled Brant, “if you had
forgotten there were two ends to a blunderbuss—one
that spat at the Garsykes sort, and t’ other that
knocked me heels over head with the back-kick. I
struck against a rock in falling, and lay silly for a
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it would be no new feeling to you, Brant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had a tongue like thine, Rebecca, I’d do two
things—tie a double knot in it, then cut it at the root.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark to him, Jonah,” shrilled the old woman,
gaunt and fiery. “Comes bringing his saucy ways
to Logie’s kitchen, where you and me live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brindled cat knew his mistress, her every look
and change of voice. His fur had been scorched,
moreover, at some time of the wild onset, and he was
in evil temper. He stalked up and down about
Brant’s knees, growling as a dog might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going Storm’s way, are you?” said the shepherd.
“You’ll be for the wild lands soon, and a dollop of
lead to teach you poacher’s shrift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen looked on, wide-eyed and troubled. In
her Highland glens they had sung of far-off battles.
She had been suckled in the faith that warriors returned
from victory with glad faces and shouts of triumph.
Yet here at Logie, safe through heavy odds, Rebecca
and the shepherd were snarling at each other, as if all
was lost. It was her first taste of battle and its aftermath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I was getting up from my dazement, Master,”
said Brant by and by, “I heard another screech
and running of the Garsykes Men, and made shift to
follow with the butt-end of the blunderbuss. But
they outran me, like. So I stepped in here, to ask
what had happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the world, Stephen—and what’s beyond it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Causleen heard the note of victory at last—heard
it in his voice. All that was Hardcastle
was hers, and she was his. She thought of the father
lying yonder. He would be content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, going to the porch to hear if there were
any lurking Wilderness Folk about the courtyard,
lifted a foot instinctively as he crossed the threshold.
He remembered the body that had fallen in answer
to his charge of shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, he <span class='it'>was</span> there,” said Rebecca dryly; “but I
took leave to shift him into the stable-yard. We’ll
hoist him over the Long Pasture wall to-morrow—and
the Garsykes sort will steal up to take him off.
They’re like rats in that way, too—attentive to their
burials.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawn crept grey and misty over Logie. And as
they stood in Rebecca’s kitchen—a silent company,
waiting for they knew not what—the old house grew
restless. It knew itself secure for a little while.
There was safety as yet, the rout of the Lost Folk.
Yet one of their dead lay just outside the porch,
pleading for reprisals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Logie was no senseless block of stone and mortar.
It had sheltered Hardcastles through seven hundred
years of weather. Its heart and spirit had grown
with the growing generations that romped and married
and died within the kingdom of its stubborn loyalty.
It had watched lusty fathers lick their sons into manhood’s
shape—listened to the muffled tread of bearers
as they carried one and another of the race to burial—heard
women groaning in the child-birth, lest there
should be none to reign in Logie-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And to-night Logie did not know what would
chance. It had felt the pain of its flaming door, had
been aware of the oaths of prowling men who threatened
walls and rafter-beams. Every nerve and sinew had
been racked by battle, and the end was not yet. The
stir of unguessed dreads to come roamed its corridors,
and sorrow piped through every casement. For
Logie had found life strong and sweet of savour, and
was loath to die.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap19'>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<h3>GARSYKES</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Nita made sport of the Garsykes Men when they
returned from Logie in the spitting rain of
dawn. Slim, and fresh as if she came out
of the new day’s heart, she waited for them in the
village. And first there came a slack-set company of
twenty, glancing behind them constantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Logie fired?” asked Nita softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, we blazed the door through,” came an answering
growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twenty men went their way, and presently
another company lumbered over the hill and down.
Most of them went lame, pitted by what Shepherd
Brant had crammed into his blunderbuss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have they done to you, there at Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita knew now that all had miscarried, and they
snarled in answer to her spite. For a moment they
had in mind to rive her limb from limb; and, knowing
the danger, she faced them with outstretched hands
and a pleading smile that might have been a child’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you hurt your little basket-weaver?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because we’re plugged with lead and rusty nails,”
grunted a shammocky rogue whose right arm hung
limp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” said another. “It was you that sent us up
to Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were round her now like wolves. Foiled and
wounded, they longed to spring on this new prey,
yet could not. Nita had queened it over Garsykes so
long that old experience did not fail her now. She
wove little, wanton spells about them—then pleaded
again with frail, helpless hands—till the old witchcraft
stirred about them. The grumbling oaths grew
muffled, and Nita, seeing them half-cowed already,
laughed with stinging mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent you up to Logie, thinking you were men.
Thirty of you went against Hardcastle and could not
take him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The snarling uproar rose afresh, but she held the
lash now and wielded it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were to bring him—alive, if might be—to
little Nita, so she could teach him many ways of
humbling pride. And all you bring is—your tattered
selves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Widow Mathison had joined them—plump and
touzled, just as she had left her bed at sound of the
uproar, except for a cloak thrown over her nightwear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All Garsykes couldn’t lay hands on one man up
yonder?” she asked, rocking to and fro with laughter.
“If Hardcastle was minded that way, I’d risk a second
wedding. The more I see of our sort, the deeper I
fall into love with Logie’s Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardcastle’s got a bonnier wench up there,” said
the shammocky rogue, striving to rally his wilting
fellows—“bonnier than Nita, if it comes to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chance shaft found its mark. The girl stood
silent for a moment, gathering years behind and years
to come into her hands. When she spoke at last,
they drew away as from some instant menace in their
midst; and each poor fool began to scratch at his
wounds afresh and to long for ale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They couldn’t bring Hardcastle to Garsykes—thirty
of our strong men could not. But little Nita
can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was bitter quiet. She did not seem to
see the frowsy press of men about her. Aloof, hard
as mid-winter on the barren uplands, she saw Hardcastle
taken in toils of her devising—and not Hardcastle
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do?” asked the rogue with the
splintered arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, what will I do? Let him wait, first of all,
till he’s sick with fear for another. Then I’ll put
fire of hell into him before ever he comes to our village
in the hills—and afterwards——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man’s full-throated curses broke across the dawn’s
stillness, and Long Murgatroyd came lurching up,
his arms thrown about two comrades who steadied
him on either side. They had clapped rough bandages
about the wound that Donald’s pike had given, and
he had thought his end was come till now, in the grey
dawn, he saw Nita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rare warrior, you,” she said, her bitterness
let loose afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The will to live returned to Murgatroyd. Hardihood
came back though his wound dripped and
snarled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye,” he said—“and I’ll wive you, soon or late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face was so white and livid in the dawn-light,
that Nita drew back with a sense of sharp foreboding.
Twice she had felt this same dread of Murgatroyd,
but it was keener now. Then she rallied her
courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When Garsykes is ended, you’ll wive me, maybe.
Can you wait as long?” she mocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can bide,” he said, and limped bravely on till he
was out of sight. Then his head drooped. “Get
me home, mates,” he muttered. “I’m sick and
wambly. Get me home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita stayed on, alone with the grey mists that eddied
over from Pengables. She thought of Logie, secure
after long warfare against odds—of Hardcastle, who
was another’s now—and no winter’s spite, packed
with hurricane and sleet, had ever blown so cold, so
merciless, as the storm in her own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An old man of the village passed, and glanced at
the silent figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your dreams, little Nita?” he asked, with
grandfatherly indulgence of a favourite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At my dreams, Tanty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s well to be young while you can,” said he,
and went by on rheumy knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Nita halted. She had spun as many webs in
her time as she had woven baskets, but none as strong
as these she was binding into a net for Hardcastle.
Like a figure of doom she stood, the wet mists hurrying
by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two weeks and a day thereafter there was peace
round Logie. No attack came on the house, no
ambush waited in the roads when dusk crept down.
Farm-servants carried Donald to the kirkyard under
the hill, and none molested the mourners in going
or returning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came afterwards the quiet, half-awed return
to usual life that follows death in any house. Rebecca
and the brindled cat got to their friendship’s bickerings.
The Master rode abroad on business of his
lands, or brought game home for the larder. And,
as if the skies were in league with peace, the long
warmth-in-winter held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen began to fret—not for the father who had
ended bravely and in happiness—but for Hardcastle.
He grew lean and gaunt, ate as if he must, with no
relish for what lay on his plate, and left the wine
scarce tasted. Try as she might, she could get no
answer to the riddle of his moodiness, until, one
morning near November’s end, he strode restlessly
about the breakfast chamber, and came to a sharp
halt before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Causleen,” he said. “I want you to go up to Shepherd
Brant’s. It’s a rough lodging—but it’s safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now she understood; and, for very gladness,
she made pretence of doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired of me already?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t jest, child.” He was hard, peremptory.
“You must go to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if I will not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall set you on pony-back and take you there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is amiss with you?” she asked—knowing,
but longing for the spoken word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear,” said Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fear?” she echoed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he paced up and down, and again came to
her side. “I’ve a lifetime’s knowledge of Garsykes,
and I tell you we’re in the thick of danger. Whenever
their silence comes——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means another firing of the house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or worse, now that you’re here at Logie. Will
you not understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If they took me from you? If you fought till you
could do no more, and they took me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should run mad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was fierce, possessive, as he drew her to him,
and she was content. The lean years of her trudging
days—weather, and blistered feet, and scorn of men
for the peddling-sort—were forgotten. Deeper than
his love of Logie—deeper than his love of life for its
own good, stalwart sake—lay fear for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll go up to Brant’s?” he said by and by, half
between entreaty and command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I—now that you care? My place is
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she cried happily against his sleeve, and he
could make no further headway with persuasion. The
next day it was the same. Whenever, out of his
stifling dread for her, he tried to get her out of Logie
and up into the trackless hills, she glanced away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re rough quarters, I know,” he would
begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That does not trouble me,” she would answer
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, of course, there’ll be only an old shepherd-man
up there, and you’d want another woman with
you. Rebecca can go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what would you do here without her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fend for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we can persuade Rebecca to it, I will go,” she
said, her glance inscrutable and grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, as time dragged slowly by, Hardcastle
learned much of the ways of women, and more and
more he was reminded of the slant, drooping flight of
plover when their nests are threatened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca’s mind had been his own—to get the girl
into safety—till Causleen’s heart to endure had captured
her grim liking. If the Master must find a wife—and
it was time there was an heir to Logie—he
might go further and fare worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot thoyle it, Jonah,” she would grumble to
the brindled cat, “but I’ve got to. Me and you
watching the Master’s goings out and his comings in—slaves,
as you might say, to his will—and a slip of a
lass making all as if it had never been. But she’s
hill-born, with a spirit of her own. That’s so much
to be thankful for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the second week was nearing its end, Hardcastle
grew so weary of the peace brooding like thunder-weather
over Logie, so sick with dread for Causleen,
that he strode into Logie like a hurricane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca was in the hall, as it chanced, plying her
broom as if it were a flail she wielded against the
Garsykes Men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Master?” she asked, standing in a
dust-storm of her own making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s this, Rebecca. You take her to Brant’s hut
to-morrow of your own will, or by mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid they’ll burn the roof over your head?
They’ve tried it twice—and we’ll teach ’em that the
third time pays for all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a fool altogether, woman? There’s
Causleen in the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, it’s her place. She’d be a poor sort o’ wife for
Logie, if she left you at the pinch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle was in no mood for argument. He told
her—simply and with command—that she must take
Causleen to Brant’s hut to-morrow. And Rebecca
grew submissive on the sudden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as well she should be away,” she admitted,
“if only for your peace of mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, however, when Hardcastle came down
to breakfast, he was met by Causleen with news that
Rebecca could not stir from her bed and sent word
to the Master that she was “twisted with rheumatics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has chosen the worst time she could,” snapped
Hardcastle. “If the woman must have luxuries of
that sort let her have them when you’re safely up at
Brant’s, the two of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen fingered the spray of crimson-berried
hawthorn she had gathered for the breakfast-table
in place of flowers. She put it into the jar, turned it
this way and that till she was satisfied, then glanced
up at Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can only be hurt through me nowadays.
You care as much as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. They can rob me of more than Logie now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garsykes knows. Gossip would tell them where
you had hidden me—and what could two women and
Brant do against them when they came—to rob you
of me, and me of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great cavern opened in the man’s heart. All that
was in her eyes, in the simple, candid words, broke
into deeps that had not been stirred till now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sending you out of my reach?” he said,
aghast at his own folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came to him of her own accord, and crept close
into his arms. “I could not bear it. I—I have
only you—and we must be together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle laughed by and by, soberly. “You’ll
have to take charge of my wits,” he said. “They
were never strong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late that afternoon, Rebecca’s ailment left her as
if by magic; and Hardcastle, returning from a journey
up the far moors, encountered her at the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tied to your bed no longer?” he asked dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can shift rheumatics as well as one here and
there, when the Master’s got rid of his own ailment.
But every talk of going to Shepherd Brant’s will make
me bedridden, and so I warn you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fell silent presently, yielding to the twilight
quiet of the place. Here the flint arrow-head had
waited on the gate-top for Hardcastle’s return when
October russeted the woods. Here Rebecca had
communed with her dead lover through forty years of
constancy to feud. They seemed to listen to the rustle
of unsubstantial feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pedlar’s girl should be proud to be among us
now,” said Rebecca, her voice low and crooning.
“All the years Logie has bided—and vengeance in her
hand at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master could not rid himself of dread for Causleen.
Fast as he beat down one attack, another fear
came shadowy at him from behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Garsykes swarms with its scum, and we are few,”
he growled. “Who made you a prophet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A step sounded up the road, and Hardcastle, turning
with quick instinct to defend himself, saw Michael
Draycott, his wide, cheery face less full of colour
than its wont.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, Michael? You look peaky, man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s this way. I found my best heifer dead
this morning—a fine little roan she was—and a
scrawled token by her side. <span class='it'>Hemlock grows in the
Wilderness.</span> That was the message.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mucky folk,” said Rebecca tranquilly. “They
were bred mucky. They couldn’t help it, maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As they’d put that on me, I knew naught else
would happen to the homestead for a bit; so I stepped
up to spend the night at Logie, by your leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve heard of something planned?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I; but they’ve let you alone so long that it
stands to reason there’s mischief brewing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca was her bustling self again. “You’re no
sort of laggard, Michael. For a man so death-shy
you do very well—and there’s a game-pie in the oven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They kept watch together that night, the Master
and Draycott, with a jug of October ale between them.
They sipped it sparingly, for it was potent, and they
kept wide ears for any sound outside the four stout
walls that sheltered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, about the middle of the watch, woke from
an evil dream, and shuddered as she lay in the darkness.
A rat scampered across the ceiling. In the
silence its feet sounded like the tramp of hurrying men,
and she lifted herself in panic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She conquered that. Fear, they had taught her
in babyhood, was a shameful thing to harbour. But
with the conquering came blinding loneliness, a reaching
out for the dead father whose voice she would not
hear again. They were kind at Logie, but it was a
house of dread. If only her father were laying below-stairs
there, his eyes kindling with welcome though
his body was outworn. If only he were living. But he
lay in the wet earth down yonder, dust to dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man’s tread came down the passage, and halted
at her door. She did not know what peril was at
hand, but roused herself to meet it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is it?” she asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who should it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relief was instant. No voice she had heard till
now had been so strong, so welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All’s well with Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Hardcastle. “All’s well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard his step go down the corridor, lessening
into silence, and a new world came to dawn, after the
nightmare that had been. Outside Logie’s walls
were skulking folk; but within their six-foot bulk was
a man after her own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice that night she heard him come to her door
again, and halt and repeat his quiet “All’s well,” and
her heart warmed to his gruff strength, as she fell into
a dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dawn was filtering through the shutters when she
woke, and her first thought was that Hardcastle
would be hungry after his long watch. Dressing hastily
she went down, stirred by a simple thrill of joy in
the hope that Rebecca would not be astir as yet.
Her own hands should prepare the Master’s breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smiling gravely at her eagerness, she stepped into
the kitchen, and was chilled, somehow, by what she
saw. The fire was dead and grey. Michael Draycott
sat wakeful, the candle by his side guttering in the
thin, peevish draught, and pointed to Hardcastle,
who lay back in his hooded chair, so fast asleep that it
seemed he would never wake again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak soft, and don’t ye rouse him,” whispered
Michael. “He kept up till the first streak o’ dawn
came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you lying to me, Michael? Is—is he dead?
I would rather hear the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll never get less from me. He’s as live as
three men put together—or will be, when he wakens
from this strong sleep of his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced about, half between relief and dread.
“I came to give him breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give him sleep instead. It’s worth more than all
the eggs and bacon ever reared in Logie Dale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unbarred the door and beckoned her out into the
nipping air that was like balm after the indoors warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad I stepped up last night,” he said, “though
naught’s happened to Logie, after all. You’re a sensible
sort of lass, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was so downright that Causleen could only laugh—a
wan little laugh plucked out from hardship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sensible lass, and not as hard as Rebecca. Well,
then, I’ve a warning for you. The Master, as I told
you, held his head up to the very minute dawn stepped
in. That meant no Garsykes sort would come. Daylight
and they were never friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Michael?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he fell back in his chair, and sleep came on
him like a wolf. He’s doing too much these days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that news to me? The grey cobwebs run
across his face. Sometimes he falters in his stride
as he comes up Logie-lane, for very weariness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, and he’ll break, one day soon, if he’s not looked
after. He never rests by day—riding, or shooting,
or what not—and he seldom sleeps o’ nights, by the
look of him. No man born o’ woman can carry it
for long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen remembered the weeks gone by. Her
pride had resented Hardcastle’s aloofness, his fits of
moodiness. Now she understood, and lifted a child’s
penitent face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you have me do?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s big, shy heart found room to speak.
“I’d have you marry him as soon as maybe. Rebecca
tells me you’re both minded that way.—And, there,
I’ve frightened you. An old man had no right to say
as much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said. “Tell me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s you that’s three parts of his trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I can go, Michael.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d only follow, and bring you back. He’s got
to that pass, he’d rather Logie went than you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood together in the stable-yard. Starlings
were making a sleepy din among the ivy, and over old
Pengables the red of dawn pushed through the mists.
The day seemed full of grey foreboding, but Causleen
did not ask what was to come. Michael’s blunt
simplicity made it sure that he was speaking truth.
“<span class='it'>He’d rather Logie went than you</span>”—the words were
like a throstle’s song in spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I will stay,” she said, and smiled on him,
and went indoors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca had come down, prepared to light the fire
and scold her way through household tasks, but even
she stood mute at sight of the Master. In all her days
she had not seen a living man so dead to sound or
motion. There was only the gentle breathing to tell
her he was more than the husk of what had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started as Causleen entered, then rasped at the
girl to cover her own disquiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, don’t you faint away, or any o’ those
maidish cantrips. There’s a time and season for ’em,
and it isn’t now. Fancied he was dead, I reckon?
Well, he’s quick. All the Hardcastles are made that
way. Gluttons for sleep they always were and will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brindled cat had learned Rebecca’s mood at
a glance and leaped to the top of a cupboard, where
he sat with vain hope that he was safe. Rebecca, in
sore and restless trouble, searched for outlet, and
her roving glance fell on Jonah. With a twist of the
long hearth-brush in her hands, she brought him
down, and aimed a wild blow at him in his flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s for washing yourself like a dandy, same
as if naught was amiss at Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she lit the fire with vicious haste; and, when
she looked up again, Causleen saw the slow, thin
tears of age trickling down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m worrited, lass, and don’t ye heed. They
can come blazing Logie down every night and all,
and welcome. It’s when Garsykes willun’t come,
and keeps us at full stretch, I get to my nagging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning went by on leaden feet. Michael
Draycott had gone to the work waiting for him at
Broken Firs. The Master slept on, spent and in
some far land that seemed neighbour to the grave.
The wind stole whining from the moors and through
the forest trees. There seemed little hope for
Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen could bear it no longer. All trouble was
easier to face in the frank open than prisoned by walls
that harboured dread. So, when Rebecca had gone
to the dairy for a moment, she stole to Hardcastle’s
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dick, do you hear me?” she whispered, longing
to hear him answer, yet hoping he would sleep on,
to find his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer came, except the <span class='it'>clack-clack</span> of Rebecca’s
pattens on the dairy floor. So then she bent and
kissed him, and went out—across the mistal-yard,
and up the home pastures, and out into the moors
that lay near to Garsykes. She needed the winds
of God about her—needed, too, in some half-confessed
fashion, to be sentry while the Master slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Logie, Rebecca went on with her cooking and
her scouring as if no inner voice was whispering of
havoc, soft-footed, stealthy. All she had longed for—all
she had prayed, through the lonely years that had
gone since they killed her man—was gathering to
a head. In her bones she knew it, as she knew
“the rheumatics” that was twisting them out of all
earthly shape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had never been Rebecca’s habit to think that
ten thousand such lean swine as the Garsykes Men
could have their will of Logie; but a dark cloud of
doubt lay between her and the further vision. There
was thunder-weather brewing, and it must break
before ever Logie came to safety and its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The teasing doubt stayed with her, till Jonah came
in, a full-grown rat in his mouth, and layed it down
before her—in propitiation, as it were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, bless you, lad,” she cackled. “If I did
dust you with a besom, it was for your good. Thwack
the male sort, say I—thwack ’em true and often—and
they thrive the better for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jonah played with the half-dead rat for a while,
then came purring and bridling against the woman’s
skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, aye, you’ve done well, lad. There never was
such a rat for bigness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more she praised him the thicker grew Jonah’s
fur, till Rebecca began to laugh shrilly at his antics.
She was in a mood to read omens into little matters,
and her spirits had risen with a bound. The Garsykes
Men were rats, and Jonah had just brought in the
first fruits of some coming slaughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rat began to stir fitfully, and Jonah, with a
sudden, growling spring, was clawing him to bits
when a shadow darkened the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca glanced up to see a little figure standing
in the porch, and her whole body stiffened, as a dog’s
might. Danger had passed by Logie through the
night; but every instinct told her it was on the
threshold now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want no baskets, Nita—leastways, none of your
weaving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not be always scolding little Nita,” pleaded
the girl. “She has no baskets to sell this morning—but
she has news to give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want no news, neither. Cannot you see I’m
throng with my cooking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My news is for the Master. Go tell him, Rebecca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had been stirring in his sleep before
she came, and her voice seemed to probe him like a
knife. He got to his feet, as if attacked. Dishevelled
by the night’s vigil, gaunt with all that Garsykes
had put on him since he said them nay, he stood
glowering at this flower-fresh visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What news?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are all so rough here. I meant it kindly—meant
to warn you—but now I will not. Go find
the pedlar’s brat if you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped forward, drew her indoors and held
her there. “Where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I fared very well at your hands, that I
should tell you? Yet I was forgiving. I could not
bear to think of her—where she is—and you to go
mad when you heard it later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s lying, the lile toad,” said Rebecca, with
grim brevity. “She never had heart to think like that,
save for one—herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Nita threw the mask off, and smiled at them.
“I was lying when I said that I forgave. I came
because I longed to torture Hardcastle of Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you shake the life out of me, how can I tell
you—even if I would?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let her go free, and presently she glanced at
him, her grey eyes wide with malice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Garsykes Men are not good at the fighting,
so they hatched another plan. If they could take
what Hardcastle holds dearest, and keep her till he
paid tribute at long last——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She halted, watching the sweat break out on the
man’s haggard face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in Garsykes. You might rouse even your
chicken-livered Logie Men to ride through us. She’s
in the caves behind our village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gulf seemed to open at Hardcastle’s feet. If
this were true—he would not have it true—and
through his dazed sickness sounded Nita’s voice, gentle
as a dove’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are long caves and deep. You knew them
as a boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, by God,” he said, towering above her with
still and awful menace, “and now I’m going to know
them as a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She halted for one last thrust. “It may be too
late for paying tribute. They may be out of hand,
now I’m not there to whip them into order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she was gone, swift as an east-wind that
had struck to the bone and stayed for no reprisal.
The Master halted for a moment, gathering his
strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not go?” said Rebecca, her lean arm
clutching him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where she goes, I go, woman. Have you no
wits to guide you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca, fear as she might for him, was glad to
see him take the Logie way—straight to the open,
though he went alone. It was only when he had
stepped into the crimson flare of dawn, flooding the
porch, that again she drew him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your two hands, and your head up to the stars,
won’t carry far these days. You’d be the better
for a gun in your hands, and a candle or two in your
pockets. Caves are darksome places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had wit left enough to get a fowling-piece and
see to the priming, while she thrust candles and a
tinder-box into his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Rebecca listened to his running stride across
the cobble-stones to the wind that rose in shrill and
bitter menace. There was only Jonah of the men-folk
left. He knew it, and sprang to her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, drive your claws in,” she snapped. “We’re
all that’s left of Logie, you and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her glance wandered forlornly round the kitchen
till it encountered the dead rat by the hearth. Then
her unalterable strength in hardship found its token.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s luck coming, Jonah,” she said, and got
about her household tasks again.</p>

<h3>SPITE’S VICTORY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, when she left Hardcastle asleep in
the hooded chair at Logie, wandered nearer
and nearer to the Garsykes country, till she
halted at last on Trolls Hill and stood looking over
the barren lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind, boisterous now, had scattered the mists,
and in the keen, chilly sunlight Garsykes village
showed clear across the hollow. She could hear voices
in its street, and wondered if they were planning some
new devilment. A woman’s raucous laugh sounded.
Was that in answer to the plotting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her courage ebbed low, after the night’s useless
vigil. There were so many of them. What chance
had Logie in the last result? Surely Hardcastle had
done enough, and might give up the unequal battle.
He had only to pay tribute, like the rest, to buy his
safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She trampled down the thought. If she had half-loved
him, that road of freedom might have brought
content. As it was, she could not bear that he should
be less than the Master, whatever came. And yet the
odds against him were pitiful, disastrous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still her glance was drawn to Garsykes, as if the very
evil of the place had cast a spell on her; and she
started when Nita Langrish stepped lightly up the
track that led from Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not afraid to be so near our thieves and cut-throats?”
said Nita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Logie does not fear such. They came, and had
their answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Riding a tall horse, are you? Logie does not fear,
says Hardcastle’s wanton, as if she was an honest
wife there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hot blood flamed in Causleen’s face, and pallor
followed. If a knife had been ready to her hand,
there would have been murder done, here where the
wind roared and fluted over Trolls Hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go,” she said, “back to the styes that bred you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go, little beggar on horseback. If you knew
what errand I have been on—but, then, you do not
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita stood poised on slender feet, like a wild deer of
the hills, but tarried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m skilled in divination,” she went on, her voice
reminding Causleen, in some haphazard way, of
Jonah, the brindled cat when he was playing with a
mouse. “Shall the basket-weaver tell you what is
coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of herself, Causleen felt weak and a child
in the other’s hands. The magic that had kept
Garsykes Men in thrall was drawing her into its webs.
She followed Nita’s finger as it pointed to the road
below, where the track from Logie split in two—one
grey lane going flat to Garsykes, the other winding
steep and rocky to a cavern gaping open-mouthed
across the green face of the pastures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see where the tracks divide?” purred
Nita. “A man will come to the two-ways by and by,
and take the upper road. And you will follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen remembered Hardcastle asleep at Logie;
and he was the one man in the world she would ever
follow willingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not true,” she said, with chill disdain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basket-weaver made no answer. But still
she did not go, and her silence began to mesh Causleen
again with unseen nets. Yonder was Garsykes, foul
and a menace centuries old. And close at hand was
Nita. She felt utterly alone, as if friendless leagues
divided her from Logie and her man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strive as she would, panic—headlong, unreasoning
panic—was stealing on her, though the sun shone and
the free winds went bristling by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita kept silence. She, of all living Garsykes Folk,
had learned most of the black magic handed down the
generations. It had been her joy to weave it into the
baskets she sold, into the ill-starred deeds her men
did by night and day—and Causleen was given into
her hands. She would half slay her now with dread,
then let her go to what they had planned for the
pedlar’s girl and Hardcastle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that was brave and Highland-born in Causleen
fought the terror stealing on her. What sort of wife
would she be to Hardcastle, if she yielded now to this
stealthy dread that came like formless mist about her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There came a whimpering through the heather.
She did not hear, till a wet nose was pressed into her
hand; and afterwards a tongue red with sheep-slaying
reached up and licked her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as on a night gone by when Storm lay in the
cupboard under Logie’s stair, she threw her arms about
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm, you’ve come,” she said, hugging his tousled
body, thick with bracken-splinters that he carried from
his past night’s lair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita drew away. Dogs always distrusted her, and
fear of the whole race—a dread half superstitious—had
grown into her life. Yet even now she could not keep
back the bitter gibe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a friend of the Master’s, too. Dear grief,
Logie keeps odd company nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm, homeless and tired of the wander-lust, had
been sending long thoughts out to Logie as he sat on a
spur of the moors and saw Causleen swing into sight
across the Garsykes track. He had bounded down—slipping
and turning a somersault or two on the way—and,
now that he was in touch again with Logie, he
was content. He growled at Nita by habit, and bared
his teeth, then turned again to Causleen and yielded
like a puppy to her daft endearments. She smelt of
home to Storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen was reliant and herself again. The coming
of this four-footed Ishmael had broken the basket-weaver’s
spells. Garsykes mattered no longer. Out
there Hardcastle was sleeping himself into new
vigour; and here was Storm, to guide her safe to the
return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Logie always had staunch friends,” she said, her
glance meeting Nita’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita made no answer, but glanced behind her;
and presently her slight body quivered with eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I lie, little wanton? A man comes up the
Garsykes road. He’s a small figure yet—but, see, he
grows bigger—and now he nears the two-ways that
I told you of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen was meshed again by webs. She could do
no more than follow the pointing finger, and watch the
man till she knew his limber stride, his way of carrying
broad shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has come to the two-roads now,” said Nita
softly—“and now he takes the higher track. Did I
lie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, in the clear light, seemed so near that
Causleen cried aloud to him, entreating his return. The
wind drove her voice back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent him there—in search of you,” said Nita.
“He thinks we have you in our caves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For one still moment Causleen paused. She knew
the agony speeding Hardcastle to the black mouth
that grinned across the pasture-lands. She knew
what leaped from her in answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You sent him there?” she echoed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—food for our Garsykes wolves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen, with sudden, blinding passion, called to
the sheep-slayer “Storm, kill her. Fasten on her
throat, Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog was far down the slope already. He, too
had seen the Master. Causleen might smell of home,
but Hardcastle was Logie’s self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pedlar’s girl raced sure-footed between the wet,
gnarled hummocks, crying as she ran with a warning
that the gale caught and drove to tatters. She came
to the parting of the ways, and followed without pause
the grey track that wound upward to the caves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle’s big figure, far ahead, halted for a brief
welcome as Storm overtook him. As if she stood
beside them, she knew what went to that greeting—the
man’s joy that he had a toothed and stubborn
friend in this adventure, the dog’s that he was with
the chosen one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back,” she cried again—so loud, it seemed to
her, that not even the wind could hinder its sharp
bidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle did not hear. Like a man possessed he
strode forward till he reached the cave’s mouth. Then
they were swallowed by the darkness, Storm and he,
and Causleen knew at last what caring meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She neither wavered nor had fear. Where he went
she would follow, by free-will and by right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita watched it all from the benty lands above—saw
Hardcastle and Storm go into the trap prepared.
Then Causleen went, and was hidden by the dark.
And after that, ten frowsy men got out from the rocks
and closed about the entry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basket-weaver took her way to Garsykes,
crooning a song of the Lost Folk—a low, stealthy
ballad, ages old, that reeked of the marshes and the
styes. And, as she came into the village, she found it
packed with men and scolding women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They snarled and jeered at her, and Long Murgatroyd’s
voice was lifted in sullen fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes Nita. She sent us to fire Logie, and
then talked big about doing what we couldn’t. She’s
laughed at us too long, the hussy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faced the answering uproar and laughed afresh
at them. “Little Nita does what she promises,” she
said, pointing to the caves above. “Hardcastle has
gone in to find his wanton, and she’s with him there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fell back then, muttering, and her tongue
whipped them as of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve trapped them for you—and you whine and
skulk here asking questions. They’d be out of the
trap by now, if I hadn’t picked ten from among you to
guard the caves—ten who shaped more like men than
rabbits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Art lying, Nita, as of old?” growled Murgatroyd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she pointed to the black mouth that gashed
the fells. And now in the keen light they saw ten of
theirs moving to and fro about the cave-front, and a
great shout went up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment they were racing pell-mell up the slope,
save for Nita and Widow Mathison, who kept the
Garsykes inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re coming to see Logie’s end?” asked Nita,
looking back after she had started to follow her men
at leisure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said the widow. “I’ve too much flesh on
my bones to care for hill-climbing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light shone in the basket-weaver’s eyes—the light
of thunder skies that ripen to full-blooded tempest.
Merciless, brooding long, her spite against Logie had
come to victory. But more than that went to this
mood of Nita’s. By mother’s milk and father’s
training she had been taught that Garsykes had
striven for centuries out of mind to tumble Logie’s
pride to ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you not come, widow?” she asked.
“There’ll be such sport as was never seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m too fat, I tell you. I should sweat myself
to death in climbing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More’s the pity, for you’d look on at what men long
dead in Garsykes hungered to see. It was left to
little Nita to bring Logie down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she mocked the widow’s grossness, and went
up the breast of the fells. And Widow Mathison got
heavily to a spur of the rising ground that gave her a
better outlook on the caves. She remembered how
Hardcastle had brought her lad from the wet of the
slimy marshes and given him back to her on a night
not long gone by. Nothing could ever bridge that
debt she owed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened to the roar of Garsykes voices, saw Nita
going tireless up the slope; and the tears ran amain
down the furrows of her plump, good-natured face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could spare most on Logie-side,” she sobbed,
“but not its Master.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap21'>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<h3>THE POOL</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had gone into the black jaws of
the cave without pause or thought of what
ambushes might lie in wait. Causleen was
here, and nothing mattered till he reached her. What
he had suffered, since first he declined to give tribute,
was child’s play measured by the agony of question
that drove him forward. Causleen was somewhere
in the gloom ahead. He was sure of finding her—yes,
but in what evil plight? With that thought came
crimson bands of flame that danced ahead. Nita
would have found vengeance sweet almost to cloying
if she had been with him in this hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm pressed close against him as he went with
lighted candle along the narrow track, turning his
head constantly to escape the dripping limestone
spears that menaced from the roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No wind stirred in the cavern. It was a breeze of
his own making that flickered the candle-glow this
way and that, throwing little, fantastic shadow-shapes
of gnomes and pixies on the rough ground beneath
his feet. He hurried forward, crying to Causleen, and a
troop of voices answered the cry, breaking it into
tangled echoes that mocked at him from roof and slimy
walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Hardcastle that a year went by before
the mockery ceased, and another voice ran echoing
through the cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Dick, come back. Come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fancied himself distraught. The voice sounded
from behind—not from the shadowed track ahead,
where fancy had painted havoc unbelievable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm, whimpering with joy, left him suddenly,
and again he asked himself if it was all a nightmare.
Would he wake in his bed at Logie, with reek of smoke
in his nostrils and knowledge that the Lost Folk were
firing the house again? He longed to wake; for
Causleen would be safe behind him, and all the flames
in front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he stood bewildered, Storm’s eager whine sounded
close, and then he came with Causleen into the sputtering
candlelight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They told me——” said Hardcastle, and could
get no further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Nita lied—and I’m here—and, Dick, come back
before they take us both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw a red gash across her cheek, and drew her
to him. “Garskyes did that?” he snarled, wolfish
as any of the Broken Folk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was so dark when I followed you and Storm, and
I blundered against something cold and hard—it
seemed like a knife hanging from the roof—and I went
slowly after that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let herself shelter awhile in the roomy haven of
his arms, then withdrew restlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s so little time if we’re to get away. Nita
went to rouse the village, and they may be coming up
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle brushed past her in the narrow track,
bidding her follow slowly with Storm as he hurried to
the cavern-mouth. He halted on the threshold. The
steep, empty brink-field stretched in front. No sound
came, except the hoarse cry of a hoodie crow wheeling
overhead. So then he stepped into the open. Ten
of the Wilderness People, lurking out of sight, sprang
at him in a body, and only his preparedness for some
such ambush saved him. With the alertness of one
lighter and more supple in the build, he leaped back
into the cave’s friendly dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One from Garsykes could not check his own forward
rush, and followed willy-nilly. Hardcastle closed with
him—the roof was high enough for a tall man to
stand upright—and his grip was so prolonged and terrible
that Causleen could hear the rogue’s bones crack
one by one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hardcastle took the broken body, using it for
shield, and went out a step or two and threw his burden
among the nine who still remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Firstfruits,” he said, and turned as a wild uproar
rang across the slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The barren pasture was swarming now with men.
There was no chance of escape in front, and again
Hardcastle leaped back across the threshold. A soft
hand found his, and a brave voice whispered in his
ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurt, Dick? Are you hurt at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but one of Garsykes is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand withdrew. She feared Hardcastle of
Logie—feared his exultation, the hard breathing, as of
a wild-beast that fought for love of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside the cavern, not ten yards from them,
a raucous din began, stilled presently by Nita’s
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s what Hardcastle has left of Jake,” came a
quavering answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You fools. I got him caged for you. I left ten
to take one as he came out with the pedlar’s brat,
thinking they had a clear run to safety. And it’s
all miscarried at the start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bade us take Hardcastle alive,” growled
another of the nine. “But for that, we could have
stoned him to death as if he’d been a conie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An easy death, and I’d planned otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Causleen’s hand crept into Hardcastle’s.
The bleak venom in Nita’s voice, the lousy uproar of
the mob so near them, put fierce gladness in her that
Hardcastle had gone wild-beast, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low, purring voice sounded again, daunting the
uproar till it ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was to be sport for Garsykes. If ten had
taken one—alive, to watch the frolic—we’d have
seen how he took it when I threw Causleen to our
wolves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, in the darkness of the cave, gripped
Causleen to him; and it was a marvel to her that his
fierceness broke no bones this time. The wet roof
dripped on them. Their only hope lay in retreat
along dank, ghost-haunted passages. Yet, deep under
all, they tasted swift content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the ten is dead,” Nita’s voice was bitter
as mid-winter now. “The nine left shall give us sport.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still closer Causleen’s hand crept into Hardcastle’s.
This was no puppet-game they played, of food and
ease and the day’s routine. It was full life together,
with death yapping at a gate they would not yield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A babel of question sounded from outside, asking
Nita what should be done with the nine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall drive them into the cave—to take him
there, if they can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle put Causleen behind him—roughly, and
with haste—and stooped for his fowling-piece. And
when Storm brushed against him, growling to be in the
thick of what was coming, he forced him back to guard
the mistress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A squealing followed, and Hardcastle, looking out
into the sunlight, saw the nine driven forward by their
fellows till one by one they plunged into the cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he lifted his fowling-piece, and snapped the
trigger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two Garsykes Men in front fell riddled with shot,
blocking the narrow way, and those behind rushed out
in panic, a prey for their own fellows. What fate
befell them, Causleen could only guess; but their
shrieks and the roar of ribald oaths were so appalling
that she put both hands about her ears, striving to
keep out the din.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lull followed, and Hardcastle spoke no word, but
stood listening to the mutterings of the enemy. Once
he turned to put his hand on Causleen’s shoulder, and
once to quieten Storm, then returned to silent waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita’s voice sounded again, peremptory and clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve tasted blood, my braves, though it’s not
Logie’s. And the taste of blood makes men even out
of such poor stuff as you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They growled at her, but Hardcastle knew that she
had them at her bidding—knew, too, that she meant
each word to reach the darkness of his prison, for sapping
of his courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ye think he of Logie is built of magic, instead of
flesh and sinew? Is he a giant too big for all Garsykes
to keep in a cave, once they’ve got him there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She mocked them, cajoled, tempted what red blood
they shared between them to mount to fever heat; and
Hardcastle, listening, admitted grimly that her tongue
was a she-devil’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten failed me, and they’ll walk Garsykes street no
more. They lost you the sport I promised—but we
still have Hardcastle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And his wanton,” hiccoughed a rough voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long Murgatroyd spoke there,” muttered Hardcastle,
with still remembrance of meetings they had
shared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And his wanton.” Nita’s laugh was soft and
girlish. “It was not the honeymoon I’d planned, but
it does well enough. We shall keep them there till the
ghosts drive them mad—or till thirst and hunger teach
them what a little thing love is. And their flesh will
rot, Garsykes Men, till the water drips on their bare
bones at last. And so much for Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot bear it, Dick,” pleaded Causleen. “She
is so evil—so evil—and God does not strike her down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ready, child?” asked Hardcastle, with
great gentleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nita spoke truth. There’s no way out of this,
except by the mouth they’re guarding. We shall die,
and I’d have it that way, if needs must—and if we’re
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say that again, Dick—<span class='it'>if we’re together</span>—and, Dick,
fear has gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiet absolute held outside, and Hardcastle’s mind
went back to many silences that Garsykes had put on
him. Those waiting-times at Logie had seemed chill
and harsh enough, but not as this was terrible. His
own house had been about him then, the forest and
the wind-sweet uplands, and he had liberty to come
and go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long while no stir of life sounded from without,
till the frosty gloaming settled on what little he could
see of the brink-field. Then again he fancied himself
in a nightmare’s grip, for the two whose bodies lay
prone at the entry, blocking the lower half, began to
move backward with rough, convulsive twists and
turns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horror of it—this watching dead men come to
life—yielded to stark common-sense as muffled curses
stole inward and he guessed that some of the Garsykes
sort had crept on hands and knees to draw out his
victims. His re-loaded gun was useless, for the living
sheltered behind the dead, and he could only wait till
the cave-mouth was clear, and all the gloaming pasture
empty save for Nita’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well done. I may tire of waiting till they
die of the ghosts and hunger. The way must be
free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle drew Causleen round the first bend of the
cave-track. His wits were keen as a razor’s edge, as he
stilled Storm’s yearning to be out and at the throats of
the besiegers. If they could not live, they three, they
must make preparations to die with seemliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one chance left,” he said. “When dark
comes, I’ll take Storm, and together we’ll stampede
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can win out in the confusion, and home to
Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dick. And what of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As if that mattered, child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if—if it mattered everything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they came near to bitter quarrel, there as they
waited for the sunset glow to die across the hills that
seemed lost to them for ever. Then Hardcastle had his
way, taking Storm with him round the bend; and she
had her way, following with mute-footed disobedience,
till they came in sight of the cave’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A crimson that was not of dawn or sunset flared
through the entry. The reek of a fire built of pine-wood
and heather was blown indoors by a wet,
gusty wind, and its heat drove inward, licking the
cave-walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the flare and cackle, Hardcastle saw men
dancing with women of the village in frank abandonment.
Wild-beast laughter made the music for their
feet, and all that had been in Garsykes, since the first
cut-throat settled there, was loosened down the ladder
of the centuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When for a moment they were tired of their devilry,
Nita’s voice rang clear and low across the spurting
flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I sing of Logie to you? Hardcastle flouted
me once, but it is my turn now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she sang a ballad in the Garsykes tongue,
that was a bastard child of the true Romany speech,
and her people, fantastic in the fireglow, roared with
applause when it was ended. They knew its meaning,
though Hardcastle could only guess how foul and
sinister it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita laughed at their plaudits, and was grave again.
“Why did I want the cave cleared of its dead? Because
every long while I shall persuade one of ours to go
in and see how it fares with our true lovers. Ah, you
back away at that, do you? Then two shall go—carrying
one man’s pluck between them—and they’ll
creep forward on unshod feet, making no sound.
Hardcastle will not know when to look for them, and an
hour will seem a month in yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do as he might, fear of the waiting-time ahead was
creeping over Hardcastle like the tide of a quiet sea.
Each word of Nita’s reached him—as she meant it
should—with an overmastering sense of prophecy and
doom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Causleen’s hand in his, and together they
went, with slow, nagging caution, along the twisting
track, Storm following. To light a candle now was to
waste what would be needed later on, and would make
them a plain mark for pursuit. They had to feel like
blind people for the rocky spears descending from the
roof. They stumbled on rubble dropped from the same
roof, and every now and then a bat brushed their faces
with a sudden, silky dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle halted often to ask Storm if he heard
aught behind them, and the dog gave a gruff “all’s
well.” Then, as a roar of waters sounded near ahead,
Hardcastle remembered the far-off day when he had
come, a boy, into this forbidden cave. The very thrill
of it returned—part fear, most of it eager courage—as
he lit his candle and went forward warily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a slippery crossing, child,” he said, coming with
her to a torrent that came from heaven knew where on
the high moors and dipped into this underworld with
foaming speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crept closer to him as she looked at the sliding
waters, at the rocky ledge above—scarce a foot’s
breadth—that was the only bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage,” said Hardcastle. “It’s a short way to
go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand was brave in his as they made the crossing,
with one slip that nearly hurled them into the bellowing
flood below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good so far,” he said. “We’ve put the
stream between the Garsykes Men and us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And afterwards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death, I fancy; but we’re together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her hand tightened its grip. He was altogether
hers, and this evil road they took tested his caring at
every turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both forgot Storm, till a whimpering came from the
far side of the stream. Fearless in a score of ways, the
look of the narrow bridge, wet in the candlelight,
daunted him. Time after time he tried to foot it and
withdrew, afraid of the cauldron underneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle gave the flickering candle to Causleen,
and crossed the bridge again, and took Storm on his
shoulders, telling him to cease wriggling unless he
meant to overbalance both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched that crossing, short as it was, as if its
length reached through an eternity of suffering.
Storm’s bulk was no light burden for a man treading
slippery rocks. At every step Hardcastle blundered
and recovered—blundered so wildly over the last of the
crossing that he had to take a sheer leap across the
torrent, to land safely on the further brink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook Storm from his shoulders, and cuffed him
soundly. “There’s no room here for fools, my lad,”
he grumbled. “Why could you not keep still?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm pressed against him with mute penitence, and
after the Master had stayed to get his breath again the
three went forward. The ground underfoot was so
broken now that Hardcastle kept the candle burning,
and by its light they saw presently that they had come
to a place of skulls—human skulls, grinning from a
tangled heap of bones. They lay in a circle to the right
of the track, where it widened for a space, and they were
no good sight for folk oppressed already with a sense
of doom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could they harm us?” said Hardcastle,
with harsh levity. “They’ve been dead too long
for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, while he spoke, Storm began to shiver as with
ague. His limbs refused their work, and his bristling
hide was dank with sweat. Causleen, her Highland
other-sight stirred suddenly, was next aware that they
stood in an underworld of ghosts, till Hardcastle himself
was shaken, remembering many legends that were
rife about the moorside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come away,” he said, gripping Storm by the
collar and dragging him by force beyond the peopled
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candle burned more wanly now. The thick,
dead air cumbered their going, and they were drenched
as with intolerable heat, though the caves were damp
and chill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we far to go?” asked Causleen faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, seeing a low slab of rock that jutted
into the track, guided her to it and kept his arm
about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d forgotten you needed rest,” he said, with grave
gentleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cool air, now that no effort was asked, revived
her weariness. “I have no fear, Dick—except that
the journey may be too long for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a long journey for us both. There’s no hope
at all of winning out, Causleen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She touched his sleeve with a caress so soft, so all-revealing,
that his hardihood was near to breaking.
“Such dreams I’ve had—of us two, and Logie, and the
summer days to come. And now they’re over—but
you are with me, Dick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dared not break the silence. So steadfastly her
spirit marched with his, that he thought of the rough
welcome he had given her when she first came to Logie.
So close they stood together now, that suddenly death
took new shape and substance. If there were to be no
mating-days with Causleen up at Logie, they must find
them in some world beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where would you have me go? I am strong again,”
she asked by and by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more, saying no word, he took her by the hand,
and they crept through the dank, lifeless air, over the
broken ground. Here and there the light glinted on
flint arrow-heads—fashioned, maybe, by the folk
whose skulls had peered at them not long ago—and his
thoughts raced back to the day when Pedlar Donald
found the token on Logie’s gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sick with defeat. He had carried his head
high above the Garsykes challenge, had gone through
peril of the roads by night and day. And this was the
finish of it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen’s hand gripped his with instant sympathy,
answering his mood. “Logie’s honour still goes safe,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It still goes safe,” was all he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The track wound downward now, till it turned
sharply, and Causleen gave a stifled cry. They had
come to the brink of a lake whose waters glinted smooth
and glossy in the candlelight. The silence they had
passed through seemed almost friendly, compared with
the nether dumbness of this pool, deep beyond knowledge,
windless, asleep with its living and its dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange beguiling came about them. Once again
they knew what Nita had meant when she spoke of
their death by hunger—or the ghosts. The pool called
them, though the silence was unbroken. Hands reached
out to draw them down, though they saw none. And
Storm stood whimpering like a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, by sheer sweat of will, drew Causleen—and
himself—from the alluring depths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the end of our journey, when worst comes to
worst,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, Dick. It is better I should know—just
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll creep on us, soon or late. And they shall
not have us, child. The pool is cleaner than the
Garsykes sort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led her over the broad causeway bordering the
lake, and as they neared its end she looked down and
recoiled. Hardcastle, following her glance, saw a stirring
of the waters that gathered strength till wavelets
licked the rock-track, and mounted till they broke
across their feet. The flickering light showed them a
great, sinewy back that threshed itself to fury. They
glimpsed for a moment the face of something half fish,
half devil, and Hardcastle himself recoiled now, drawing
Causleen close against the wet precipice. He was
in the grip of a cavern that sheltered primeval ghosts
and age-old, living things, and the heart went out of
him for one sick moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever monster lurked in the bottomless waters,
it had plunged deep out of sight again, and the
back-wash of its going drenched the three of them
with chill, spumey spray. Storm cried piteously,
till Hardcastle, with a rough oath, cuffed him into
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their candle, held high above the spray, flickered and
went out, and Hardcastle let it fall, knowing his tinder-box
was drenched and useless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the end of all?” asked Causleen, reaching
for his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The end. Nita will send her swine—be sure of
that—and they might take you, child, after I was
beyond aiming another blow. But it’s in my heart to
kill another Garsykes Man or two before we go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her grasp tightened. He had spoken quietly, without
haste, as if he were reckoning the chances of the
weather when they mowed the hay at Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not fear the pool, Dick—or the dark—if
we’d not seen what lurked there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better even that than Garsykes,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She crept nearer to him, and they stood there on the
brink of dread, waiting for death. The lake still lapped
and gurgled at its rocks. Storm whined fitfully, afraid
of things more terrible than his second-sight had ever
glimpsed on the wildest moorland nights. He had seen
Habatrot go by, and the Heather Dwarf, and the dog
shaggy as himself—the dog known as Guytrash, that
waited on lonely gates and frightened his own kin, who
shuddered by and would have none of usual, honest
fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Storm, as he shared this night watch with his chosen
two, longed for the moor-winds and the sky. Nothing
he had found there—the worst of it—was like this
sick, clammy air, peopled with foul shapes of the
underworld.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is beyond?” asked Causleen by and by.
“Cannot we get further down the track?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that she was thinking of the pool’s occupant,
was dreading its return. One hand still held his
fowling-piece above the wet. The other closed on hers
with a grip quiet and resolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few yards would bring us to the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He humoured her, and they crept forward slowly
round the bend that Hardcastle remembered from the
far-off day when he had travelled the cave’s length.
Then he had had candlelight to help. Now he had
none; and from the very lack, hope came to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he turned the bend, the darkness seemed to grow
less heavy. He crept on, feeling the way with his one
free hand, till a gentle glow began to steal between the
rocks that hemmed them in; and with a bound his
mind returned, as Storm’s had done, to the free moor’s
overhead. So it had been when he set out on stark,
mid-winter nights to cross the heath on foot—nothing
at all to see in front at the start, but presently a gleam
of grey that showed a filmy track ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His grip on Causleen’s hand tightened till she winced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know,” he said, harsh in this moment of
swift, unlooked for hope. He had had many such, and
feared to lose it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The track brought them soon to the rock-wall that
had seemed impenetrable when Hardcastle, as a lad, had
held his candle-flare to its wet face. The candle’s flame
had been stronger than the grey-blue gleams that broke
now into the blank and utter darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the wall’s face they ran, these gleams, in
soft, ever-moving rivulets that were narrow and
broad by turns, criss-crossing like the hurry of a
water-slide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fearing almost to put hope to the test, Hardcastle
stretched out his hand into the grey-blue gleam where
it ran widest. His hand passed through it. His
eager fingers reached beyond the wall’s fancied
thickness and closed on it. He dragged an inch
or two of rotted stone away, and turned with
guarded triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We may outwit both Garsykes and the pool,” he
said.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap22'>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<h3>THE END OF STORM</h3>

<p class='pindent'>By her silence, by the sob that followed, Hardcastle
learned the measure of Causleen’s dread of what
lay behind them. He learned, too, the depth
of his fear for her—a terror that ate still at his heart
and goaded him to effort. The very chance of release,
the nearness of it, made him the more eager to win
through with haste, lest Garsykes came at them just
too soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cave drives us mad,” said Causleen, light-headed
for a moment between strain of fear and stress
of hope. “How can there be little threads of light,
stealing from outside—from God’s good out of doors,
Dick? It’s night out there, except for the fire that
Nita lit, far away. Surely it was far away. We’ve
journeyed many a mile since then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, seeing how it went with her, put a firm
hand on hers. “Would you faint at journey’s end?
And where’s your Highland pride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He loathed himself for saying it, though it brought
her back from sickness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, Dick,” she said, and was quiet awhile.
“Here, Dick,” she said again, her whole body quivering
with release from dread. “There are Highland pipers
stepping down the cave—and pride marches with
them. But we two are mad to dream that light
comes from out of doors. How could it? We
watched the sun go down—years since—before Nita
lit her fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he was compelled to rally her. She had gone
through more than should be asked of any woman; but
needs must that she kept weariness at bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a wall to be broken down,” he said sharply.
“Take my gun, Causleen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The command steadied her again. Obediently she
took the fowling-piece and watched him tear at the
rock-wall, getting his fingers in where the grey-blue
light rippled at its widest. Piece after piece of wet-worn
rock crumbled to his grasp, till he got his arm
through at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen saw a broader stream of light break softly
through the dark. Storm, the sheep-slayer, was
pressing his rough snout against her, and somehow he,
like the Master, brought courage home again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can the light break through?” she asked, as
a child might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glanced back from the sweat of his toil.
“There’s a full moon on Logie-side, and we’re winning
fast to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God be thanked,” said Causleen. “And shall
we see the hills again, Dick, and hear the winds go by?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With luck, we shall,” said Hardcastle, riving at the
wall-face afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was checked now by a thicker and less yielding
slab of rock. Tug as he would, his grip was powerless
to widen the breach, and again the sense of desperate
haste returned. They were so near freedom, but behind
them was all the stealth of Garsykes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt about in the rubble at his feet till his hands
closed on a round boulder-stone, and with this he
hammered feverishly wherever a crack showed. He
was steaming now with the effort, and the slender
breeze that drifted in through the opening he had
made, did little to relieve the cavern’s dank, lifeless
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last there was an answer to his toil. The cracks
broadened suddenly, and the next hard blow brought
a mass of splintered stones to ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle went at it with fresh, dogged hope. Slow
as the work was, he could get one shoulder through
the opening now, and the thought came, across the dull
confusion of his mind, that Causleen needed a narrower
doorway out than he. Another fall like the last, and
she could creep sideways into safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thought was food and drink to his strength.
Once she was safe, the worst was passed; and Storm
and he, surely, could hold this narrow way till no pursuit
could reach her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more he fell to hammering wherever the blue-grey
moonlight showed a crack, but the reward was
long in coming; and, as he rested for a moment from
sheer lack of breath, Storm broke the quiet with a low,
purring growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No ghosts were troubling the sheep-slayer now,
So much was plain. His hide was stiff, not with dread,
but with eagerness to be at the throat of some menace
threatening from behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle quietened him with one sharp whisper,
and took the gun from Causleen’s hands. Then
he pushed his fowling-piece into the gloom, and
waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twice Storm growled, so low that Hardcastle could
scarcely catch the note. And still they waited—bond-brothers,
side by side—for what was coming through
the stealthy dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hardcastle felt a bulk of flesh steal against the
muzzle of his gun, and plucked the trigger. The back-throw—not
of the butt against his shoulder, but the
answering uproar of the cave’s low roof—drove him
staggering back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two had come against them, it seemed. He heard
Storm’s eager yelp, a man’s sudden scream of anguish,
and an answering howl from Storm. And then there
came a din of falling rocks, a rush of clean, cold wind
that brought a flood of moonlight with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you safe, Causleen?” he cried through his
dizziness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A low voice answered. “That was your first
thought? Yes, I’m safe, Dick—doubly safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her touch made light of hardship. Two more of
Nita’s men were blocking the cavern behind them with
their dead, ill-kempt bodies, and there was time
enough now to hack a way through for Causleen
and himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he turned to batter at the rock-face again, he
found the work done already. The gunfire shock that
had driven him back and roared loud as an earthquake
in the narrow space, had probed into every crevice of a
barrier near to falling long ago. The way now lay open
to them, over broken rocks that showed fantastic in the
moon-glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, exultant, was reaching for her hand, to
guide her through the wreckage, when he remembered
Storm and whistled sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A snout was pushed against his knee, and he reached
down to pat the dog’s rough hide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re as drenched with sweat as I am, lad,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Storm was, though he had no speech to tell them
that the sweat ran crimson. He had killed his man,
but in the doing had taken a knife-wound that raked
half down his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t whimper. Storm,” murmured Causleen.
“The cave’s full of ghosts, I know, but we’re free
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep-slayer whimpered no more. With extreme
pain he followed them across the broken way, till they
reached smooth going again. Storm was not sure that
they were free, and to the last edge of his strength he
meant to guard these two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle saw now a wide arch of moonlight close
ahead. He could hazard no guess as to the corner of
Logie-land that it opened on. He did not care,
for beyond it lay the free sky and the fells; and
whatever battle waited would not be clogged by
prison walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before they had covered half the short way to liberty,
Causleen’s hand gripped his with sudden dread. Behind
them was a rumble, as of thunder, followed by a
cracking and a rending overhead. Hardcastle, it
seemed, when he first made space enough to get a
shoulder through the barrier, had loosened the frail
keystone of the roof, and they were stifled by the dust
and uproar of the falling rocks behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew Causleen sharply back and through the
moonlit opening, and Storm had scarcely struggled
after them when a second tumult sounded from
the cave behind, and a pile of shattered rocks came
crashing to the very mouth by which they had
escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hardcastle, his arm round Causleen still, drew
a deep breath and glanced in silence at the moonlight
flooding all the land in front. He had not known
how sweet and all-sufficing a night wind could be,
had never tasted until now the fullest joy in sight—sight
to see the strong free spaces of his own good
country-side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For awhile he did not care to ask where they were
standing. It was enough to remember the cave’s
unclean nightmare, and to wash in this swift moorland
air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The joy of it,” sobbed Causleen, her head against
his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now he remembered that joy was apt to be
short-lived, with Garsykes as close neighbour. For
aught he knew, Nita and the men who watched the
bonfire at the other entry might be close at hand. The
track through the cavern, long as it was, twisted so
constantly that it might have led them back within a
stone’s throw of the start.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced this way and that, listening. No sound
came, save the wind’s voice, till a screech-owl hooted
from somewhere far below. A raven’s sleepy croak
answered. That was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood on a spur of pasture-land that dipped
sharply down in front, and Hardcastle went forward
in search of landmarks. Moonlight is apt to play
strange tricks with the most familiar hills and cloughs;
but he could not mistake the ravine that gaped below,
black with shadow under the radiance that lit its upper
banks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw where it narrowed at Nevison’s Leap, and
where it broadened to the mist-white flats. And,
beyond again, Pengables Hill looked out at him with
the gaze of an old and proven friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re in Drumly Ghyll, sweetheart,” he said, “and
a clear road home for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A yelp of pain sounded from behind—so sharp, so
strong with anguish, that joy in freedom went from
them. They turned to see Storm dragging himself
forward, wincing at every step, and Hardcastle ran
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep-slayer paused a moment, to gather
his failing strength. Then he got his forepaws
up to the Master’s shoulders, with a farewell that
gushed crimson, licked his face once and then fell
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the good brute,” said Hardcastle, with a grim,
sudden oath. “His hunting days are over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not dead?” Causleen pleaded, knowing the
futility of what she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not hear, and her own sorrow was checked for
a moment at sight of his. In silence and in grief he
stood looking down at this lost comrade who had been
with him through the long, unequal fight of Logie
against the Wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t leave him here to the corbie-crows,”
he growled at last—“or for the Garsykes sort to
mock at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen’s tears were running fast as she knelt beside
the gaunt, still body. “Storm, come back,” she
whispered. “You’re too brave and dear to die like
this. We need you, Storm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle watched her in gloomy silence, till
thought of all she had gone through overmastered
him with a sharp rush of pity. He lifted her with
a strength that was persuasion, too, and held her
close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather have it this way, child. He died for
Logie—not at Brant’s hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled wanly through her tears. “He had
his faults—but I—I shall miss him. He used to
come to the cupboard under the stair—so wise and
penitent, Dick, so loyal—and now he’ll never come
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put her from him, with the same gentle
strength, and shouldered what was left of Storm.
Then he went down into Drumly Ghyll, and presently
returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done with him?” she asked
piteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lies deep in Cobblers’ Gully, safe from crows and
foxes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Storm,” she said, and was silent. Then,
“Did you send a prayer with him?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I know of praying? He’s gone, and part
of me went with him, somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They said no more as they went down together
through the midnight of Drumly Ghyll—its high walls
closing round them like another cave of dread—and out
into the moonlit lowlands. It was only when they
came near to Logie Bridge and all its memories
that Causleen broke down again, remembering
Storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lies so lonely, Dick, up there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm hadn’t much of a life on this side. He was
glad to go, maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So then Causleen knew that a prayer had gone with
the dead dog into Cobblers’ Gully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went together up the steep, winding road to
Logie—its guardian beeches comely in their winter’s
nakedness—and at the bend they encountered Rebecca—the
brindled cat snarling on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it your ghost, Master?” she quavered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fairly solid ghost, Rebecca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then God be thanked, say I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was old, and shaken by her vigil. Her hair was
driven by the breeze into grey, wispish threads; but her
eyes, even in the tempering moonlight, showed like
pools of living fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feared there’d be no home-coming for you two,”
she said, the tang returning to her voice already—“especially
when Brant and Michael Draycott came
back with the tale of what they’d seen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should they know about the cave?” asked
Hardcastle, with tired wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I chose to tell Brant when he stumped into
my kitchen, a half-hour after you’d gone, and grumbled
that Storm had taken another ewe of his in the night.
‘I wouldn’t worrit about that,’ says I. ‘Garsykes
has taken the Master, and I’m nigh out o’ my wits.’
That sobered the shepherd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She touched Hardcastle, to make sure that he was
in the flesh before her, then told, in tart, brief speech,
how Shepherd Brant had gone to raise Logie-side
against the Wilderness—how all its strapping yeomen,
except Michael Draycott, were at Skipton market—how
Michael and Brant had stolen down to the Garsykes
hollow, to see if they could put a fight up, and had
found a company of devils dancing with Nita round a
fire at the cave’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tired as he was, needing food and drink, and sleep’s
forgetting of the cave, the Master warmed to Rebecca’s
tale. There were two men at least who had cared to
rouse the Dale for him and all that Logie stood for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They came back here,” said Rebecca, “for bite
and sup before they left again to meet the Logie Men
as they rode home from market. I wouldn’t daunt
their spirit by telling ’em there was a full moon, and
our men by that token would come late, with a plenty
of good ale inside them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That same full moon, Rebecca,” said Hardcastle,
with chastened humour, “showed us the way out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened, her lean, old body tense with eagerness,
as he told what had chanced. Then she was no longer
the woman who had waited, every fear on edge, for news
that could only be evil, so it had seemed through the
long waiting-time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Master was home again, tall and limber, though
his coat was drenched with blood. His old laugh was
in the front of hardship. He was glad, with a clean,
hard joy, to have brought Causleen safe to Logie, after
all, through moil of the Garsykes Men. And Rebecca
was glad with him—fiercely glad that the Wilderness
had been outwitted once again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every sorrow she had known, since her own man died
for Logie forty years ago, returned now to this grey
henchwoman of the house—the wedded days she should
have had, the bairns that might have been—and hate
of Garsykes swept through her like a tempest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she saw the Master and Causleen glance at each
other with such silent, all-sufficing knowledge that
jealousy chilled her to the bone. Why should they
come in their young, insolent strength, and flaunt their
caring in her face?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brindled cat was in ill-humour, too. All day he
had wandered from house to stable-yard in search of his
boon-comrade, Storm, and now the friendly reek of him
stole out from Hardcastle’s drenched coat. Jonah
leaped from Rebecca’s shoulder, and purred and
growled by turns, reaching up to sniff the scent that was
Storm’s, but with a cold, dismaying difference. Then
the cat neither growled nor purred. All the life
seemed to dwindle in him. The fur, stiff with battle,
fell limp and draggled, and he mewed with piteous
appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone away, Jonah,” said Hardcastle, a queer break
in his voice. “Storm’s sleeping up the fells.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap23'>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<h3>THE QUIET WEDDING</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Garsykes Folk had grown tired of guarding the
cave mouth. For a night, and half the next
day, Nita’s tongue had whipped them into
watchfulness; and when they were growing out of hand
at last, she made light of what Hardcastle could do to
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get you in first, Long Murgatroyd,” she gibed.
“What with the ghosts and the silence, we’ve tamed
Hardcastle by this time. You needn’t fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd fetched a laugh up, big as his body.
“If you’ll come with me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The devil in her warmed to what she would find,
somewhere along the track in yonder. To see Hardcastle
distraught with fear and hunger—to have him
cringe to her for the means of safety—that was the
dream she had woven into her baskets for many a
month gone by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took Murgatroyd’s hand, with a light and eager
smile, and together they went into the cavern whose
every winding was known to the rabble that followed
with shrill, raucous jests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had candles in plenty, to scare the ghosts away;
but somehow their laughter grew afraid of itself, and
died out in eerie echoes, passed on from the wet spear-points
of rock that came straight, like arrows, from the
roof above. Then the whole cavern was filled with
rolling murmurs that passed on their oaths into the
everywhere beyond; but Nita kept them trudging
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They crossed the torrent. No trace of life showed,
no sign of struggle. And now they reached the lake,
and Nita paused at its brink, looking down into its
unstirred waters. Were Hardcastle and the pedlar’s
brat lying there, she wondered? But, if that had
chanced, why had two Garsykes Men not returned—the
two she had sent with knives to kill Hardcastle and
torture Causleen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>One question was answered speedily, as she and Murgatroyd
turned the bend of the track and saw two
huddled shapes blocking their way. Murgatroyd
roared with sudden terror, but Nita, laughing at him,
held her candle low above the dismaying sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man shot by Hardcastle at close quarters showed
less ghastly than his fellow, for the charge had gone
through him like a single bullet; but the other lay face
up to the roof, and Storm’s fury was plain about his
tortured throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” growled the men behind, catching
panic from Murgatroyd’s bellow of affright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two of ours that could well be spared,” said Nita,
and stepped on the fallen, and went forward for a pace
or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” came the uneasy question again as
they heard a sharp cry escape her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The end of Logie. Come see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gathered courage from the exultation; and
those who could press into the new cavern, formed to
the left hand of the track, lifted a score of candles to
what had been the end of their rock-fastness. The
straight-faced barrier they had known was now a mad
confusion of rocks broken into shapes fantastic, terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s their marriage-bed,” said Nita, her voice
childest in its gentleness—“Hardcastle’s and his
wanton’s. Did I say there’d be an end of Logie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man was always a bit of a fool,” growled
Murgatroyd, recovering from his panic. “I reckon he
loosed his fowling-piece on one o’ the two we trod on.
A toddling Garsykes kid could have told him what it
’ud do to pent-in walls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Nita, treading on light feet, led her men back
through the cave, and out into the sweet upland air of
afternoon, she took them straight to Widow Mathison’s
inn, and left them there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink your fill, now Logie’s gone,” she said, and
went up into the fells.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near dusk she returned, and called them out from the
ale that had merried them—called them into the
cobbled street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Nita wise?” she asked softly. “Did she
promise Logie’s end?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They roared an answer, and suddenly she fell to
dancing for their pleasure. The last crimson of the
sunset flared down and over from Pengables Hill, and
lit her slender paces and her slender limbs. As her
fingers wove dark magic into the baskets she sold down
and up the Dale, her whole body now snared and enticed
the men she loathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then once more she left them, going fleet-footed as a
deer up the darkening fells, and came to her cottage
where the little fir-wood rustled in the breeze. She
slept as a tired child might, and soon after dawn went
to her bath in the pool within the wood. Then she took
the fell-track to Logie, and came to the open door of
Rebecca’s kitchen, and stood there, darkening the
wintry sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Master has not returned?” she asked softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca had looked for some such visit, and glanced
up from dusting the china dogs on the chimney-shelf.
“Not yet. But what is that to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He followed the pedlar’s girl into the cave, they tell
me, and neither will come back, I fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s still me and the brindled cat left, and
we’ll see to Logie. Tell Garsykes from me, you basket-weaving
trollop, that I’ll comb ’em with the thick end
of a besom if they try their pranks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita could make nothing of the woman, so hard, so
unmoved by the Master’s fate. “Have you no
fear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, for such as you, once my fingers get about you.
You’d best be gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita tarried only for one last shaft before she fled
from the other’s truculence. “The Master’s gone.
And old Rebecca’s wits have gone. It’s the rarest
day that Garsykes ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe,” muttered Rebecca, as she got to her
dusting again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew how, after their safe return from the cave,
Hardcastle had left Causleen in her care while he went
up the moonlit road to join Shepherd Brant in his
waiting for the Logie yeomen to return from market.
She knew how he had probed under their lazy tribute-giving
by plain recital of what had happened in the cave,
and had pledged them to guard Logie whenever he
himself had need to tide abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the Master had ridden over-hill to Skipton,
on an errand that she guessed; and Causleen herself
lay in the room above, in a dead sleep of weariness that
was saving life and reason after the hell she had passed
through in the cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re the one spoil-sport among us, my brindled
cat,” she snapped, as Jonah mewed about her skirts.
“I loved old Storm myself; but he’s gone, and you
can’t mew him back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour she went about her work, then grew as
restless as Jonah himself. It was time the Master was
home again, and he tarried. What if, at the end of his
rough journey through the cave, his horse had thrown
him somewhere between this and Skipton? Life, as
she knew it, had that apeish way of letting folk
go safe through harsh odds, only to crack thin skulls
against a moorland boulder as they rode quietly
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keenly as Rebecca listened for the tip-tap of hoofs
up the road, Causleen heard it first. She wakened from
a sleep befogged by peddling days, and memories of the
harsh greeting she had found once at Logie—sleep
threaded through and through by flame-red memories
of Garsykes and its cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far down the road she heard the music of her man’s
returning—<span class='it'>clickety-clack</span>, faint at first as the tread of
elfin feet. Where had he been, risking his life in these
disastrous days? And was he wounded by a stealthy
blow aimed at him by some foul lout from Garsykes
lurking in the heather?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Need to know how it fared with him drew her from
her bed. She put the frayed cloak about her—the
cloak that had been blue as hope once, but now was
like a Jacob’s coat, painted by many kinds of
weather—and went down the stair, and out to Logie’s
gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in time to open it for Hardcastle, in time to
see the light in his eyes as he got from the saddle, and
told his horse to find his own way to stable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where have you been?” she asked, fingering his
sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Skipton-in-Craven,” said Hardcastle. “I had
business there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She touched his sleeve no longer. “And left me
here—alone, except for Rebecca and a farm-lad? At
such a time—after all we’d shared, and with Garsykes
near—<span class='it'>You went on business?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left a body-guard. Some of our Logie Men are
in the woods—and two by Logie Brigg, to let none from
Garsykes through—except Nita, if she’s a mind to
come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took a further step away. “You might have
stayed, for all that—just to be near me, Dick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went over-hill for the right to keep you near.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had known him taciturn and hard, known the
laughter that came rarely and was far away from joy;
but now he was a riddle, as he took her hands and would
not let them go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You left me so soon—for what?” asked Causleen
wearily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His heart spoke now. By all he said and left unsaid
she knew at last the caring that had come at the end of
their uphill, stormy wooing. Garsykes might be
broken, once for all, he told her; but the old, stealthy
siege of Logie might be renewed by slow degrees.
Either way, they’d meet the coming weather as man
and wife. The licence would be ready in three days’
time, and it was no far ride to Skipton Kirk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was your business?” she asked, her voice brave
and vibrant. “And I chided you—and so, Dick, do
what you will with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his will was made plain, however, that on the
fourth day from now they would be married, she was
submissive no longer, but pleaded for delay. She had
no clothes for her wedding, and would shame him in his
own market-town unless he gave her time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wear the old cloak over all,” said Hardcastle,
“and I’ll be content enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So there came a day when Rebecca watched them
ride out from Logie. The Master had not said what
their errand was, but she knew; and she scolded Jonah
till he spat at her. And then she gathered him into her
arms, and cried, and cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love of a man sees far, when you’ve mothered
his cantrips since he was a babby,” she said by and
by, with a smile utterly forlorn. “And jealousy sees
far. But it’s hell’s own spite when the two keep
company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen and Hardcastle guessed nothing of all this,
as they rode, in wonder and in silence, over the hill to
Skipton. They guessed nothing of it as they rode home
again, drawing rein to glance at the pride of that one
word, <span class='it'>Desormais</span>, carved high above the grey, stubborn
castle-gateway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long as he had known it—and he rode seldom from
Skipton without a glance at the message overhead—Hardcastle
had taken it as a symbol of his own grim
fight for Logie. Now that was changed. He had a
wife beside him, and the feud with Garsykes grew
doubly worth the while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at the carved challenge, and made
English of it for her. “<span class='it'>Henceforth</span>, sweetheart,” he said,
and laughed quietly as a conqueror might.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence they rode past the castle walls and up into
the grey, solitary fells. The track twisted this way and
that to lessen the steepness of the climb, till they
breasted the last of the hill and passed through the
rocky gap that was the gateway of the homeland
watered by Wharfe River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew rein, and could only marvel at the land
stretched wide below them. The winter’s sun shone
warm and mellow over the far spaces, grey-blue with
haze. Every striding league of heath, each gully where
leafless rowans waited for the spring, showed to Hardcastle
like the map of his own heart. Pride—big
hearted, eager pride—leaped out as he pointed down
the slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We own most of it, wife. Is it a good bridal-gift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes filled with tears. He gave all he had, for
her to share. And he named her wife. She had not
guessed how all-sufficing the name was, how real and
warm and safe. And somehow, across the chill upland
breeze, a summer fragrance blew, as of clove-pinks and
ladslove in a wayside garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All they had gone through together returned—the
stealthy siege of Logie, the stark, long peril in the cave—and
she drew a sharp breath of thanksgiving that this
was the end of nightmare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is sweet to hold, Dick,” she said, smiling
through her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode in another silence, rich with speech, down
the slack of Storner Bank. And now the wood-reek
from Logie’s chimneys eddied up, so near that they
could smell its savour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re home,” said Hardcastle, drawing his horse
nearer hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as they rounded the bend, he pulled up
sharply. Nita Langrish, a bundle of withies over her
shoulder, was standing in the roadway, her glance fixed
on Logie. So intent she was on thoughts of the dead
Master who had flouted her—hidden deep with the
pedlar’s brat under the rocks in Garsykes cave—that
she heard no sound of hoofs behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita had had her will of them both, and stood there
as in a trance. Vengeance was sweet. She was
minded to taste it to the full, looking down at masterless
Logie. Every curling wisp of smoke rose from a hearth
Hardcastle would never know again. No son of his
would grow to claim the heritage. Logie and its seven
hundred years ended with old Rebecca and a brindled
cat; and so much for pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man’s cry of warning roused her, and she turned
to see Hardcastle’s cob rearing scarcely a yard away,
his fore-feet perilously close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita leaped aside, then stood gazing at these two who
were buried in the cave out yonder—these two, who
seemed to ride on horseback through the sunlight and
the free moorland wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle glanced once at her. It was not his way
to fight with women; but a sullen loathing came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re dead in Garsykes cavern,” he said. “It’s
only our ghosts that ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only your ghosts?” asked Nita eagerly, snatching
at a straw in this torrent of dread that raced
over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Storm’s,” said Hardcastle. “He died with
us, and runs close behind, I fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that they rode on, and Hardcastle’s grim smile
died out as he glanced at Causleen’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re tired, wife,” he said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was not tired at all until—until she stood there—stood
on the threshold of our home-coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow crept, too, about Hardcastle and stayed
with him as they came indoors, Causleen and he, and
found Rebecca waiting for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Step forrard,” said Rebecca. “It was time you
married, Hardcastle of Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you know?” he asked, wondering that
there was no need to break the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaunt and straight, Rebecca stood facing them with
a hard, roving glance. “How did I know, asks he,
when I’ve given my life to watching his ins-and-outs?
How could I help but know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one side of the threshold Nita had met them.
On the other stood this henchwoman, grief and jealousy
showing in her sombre eyes. Against their will, a
sense of doom crept out from Logie’s storied walls,
chilling their eager wedlock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I kept young for you, Master,” went on Rebecca,
“till you found a bride for Logie. And now I’ll let
myself grow old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have told you our errand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cut short his troubled words. “You would, but
for thinking of old Rebecca. The blow would fall
softer, you fancied, if you brought a full-fledged wife,
instead of letting me wait all day for a promised one.
Men, poor lambs, are not good at breaking news, and
never were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her tart humour swept him like a moorland
breeze through the gloom she had brought about
these two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve the bridal-supper ready, and near spoilt. You
were always late to your vituals, Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat on in the kitchen, after all was served and she
had left them to their meal; and she missed Jonah
sorely. The cat had been with her till the moment
when she went to greet the bridal-pair, and now had
vanished like her own joy in serving Hardcastle. All
had gone, it seemed, and she yielded to loneliness utter
and complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw her apron over her head, and rocked to and
fro. Grief had its way with her. The years behind
gathered their hardships to a head, and tears broke
through at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then by and by she heard the kettle singing on the
hob, and made a hefty brew of tea. And after that she
went in search of Jonah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard her tramping forlornly upstairs and
down, and Causleen’s hand reached out to Hardcastle’s
across their wedding-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s old and sorry, Dick—and we’ve so much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle found a quick new tenderness for this wife
of his. She knew, as he did, that Rebecca was bone
and fibre of his house—one by this time with its thick-set
walls, the people who lived here aforetime—one to
be cherished like a heritage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together they went in search and found Rebecca
standing at the cupboard under the stair. The door
was open, and her candle showed the brindled cat spitting
and growling from the lair he had shared with
Storm on many a day gone by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candlelight showed something else to Causleen,
her vision sharpened by this wild home-coming—showed
her the shape of Storm, the sheep-slayer,
with a long, brown-red gash across his filmy hide—Storm,
who was dead, returned to Logie and the
Master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had made a bitter jest to Nita of
Storm’s following them, a ghost. And Storm was
here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’ye see,” asked Rebecca—“what d’ye see,
beyond that dratted cat o’ mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A leal friend, Rebecca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that she put a hand in Hardcastle’s, ready
for whatever weather came to Logie. The end of the
stark battle was not yet.</p>

<div><h1 id='chap24'>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<h3>A GAOL DELIVERY</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The Wilderness Folk were aghast, in the days that
followed, to see dead Hardcastle riding with
Causleen, man and wife, across the uplands.
Flesh and blood they could not be, for all Garsykes
knew that they were buried in the cave. Yet flesh and
blood they were, glad of each other and the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old superstition bred and festered in the Garsykes
hovels. It was ill-luck and always had been, to run
counter to a Hardcastle, whatever toll they took of
those farming under him. Strange tales were bandied
to and fro in Widow Mathison’s inn by greybeards of
this Lost Village under the hills—tales of the ancient
days, when one and another from Garsykes had held
up a Master of Logie on the road and brought confusion
on the settlement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve the luck, these damned Hardcastles,” the
tale would finish always. “It’s no use trying to
meddle with Logie any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita Langrish had shared their gospel for awhile.
Then she had rallied from the shock of seeing Hardcastle
ride home with the pedlar’s girl—the bridal-look about
their faces, and both on horseback instead of lying
under piled rocks yonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each time she met them afterwards, her purpose
hardened. She lay awake o’ nights no longer, wondering
how they had won free of the cavern. It was
enough to know that the pedlar’s brat was mistress now
at Logie—reigning where she might have taken pride
of place, instead of weaving baskets for up-Dale folk
to buy. Through the weeks and months she waited,
striving to put some sort of courage into her slack-set
people, and telling them always that dead men of theirs
cried out for vengeance against Logie. Memory of
these deaths, and the way of them was too sharp at
first; but fear lessened by degrees, and Nita fanned
the dull embers of resentment into life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As winter stepped through March gales to springtime,
and the fells were white with lambs newborn, Hardcastle
took a lusty hold of life. The lean years had
gone out of mind. The only thought he gave Garsykes
was a warning to Causleen not to roam abroad without
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had little need. On horseback or afoot they
were together constantly; and, as he taught her the lore
of ancient lands and storied bridle-tracks, she lit his
heritage with new, fresh wonder, as of dawn after a
long night’s tempest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Closer they came together, and closer, as the spring
advanced and cowslips nodded in the meadow-grass.
Sometimes Hardcastle would fall silent, afraid almost
of his joy in living; and her hand would slip through
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, Dick?” she would ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half of me has come back,” he would answer, smiling
down at her—“the half that’s been missing all these
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca, too, was in better heart. Jealousy yielded
by degrees to a new, enthralling hope. As she baked,
and scrubbed, and churned, a little song would creep
into her mind, and stay there. Logie might have an
heir at last. And she would dandle him on knees hard-worn
in Logie’s service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When June was well in, and the meadows growing
strong for the scything-time, Shepherd Brant stumped
into Rebecca’s kitchen one morning and sat him down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” she snapped. “What’s wrong this time?
I’d as little expect to see thee without thy shadow,
Brant, as without a grievance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s wrong? Why, Garsykes. It’s humming
like a hornets’ nest again, they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guessed as much. Jonah gives me less of his
company these days, and sits a lot in the under-stairs
cupboard. So I know Storm’s there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and your ghosts, woman. I’ve no patience.
Dead men can walk—I’ve seen a few in my time—but
it’s a heathen fancy that the four-footed sort have
spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some o’ the four-footed have a bigger spirit than
some o’ the two-legged, and have a properer right to
walk. But, then, you were always against Storm,
poor martyr,” she added, re-opening their ancient feud.
“It wasn’t enough that he died for the Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a sheep-killer he died fairish well. I’ll own to
as much as that,” broke in the other, tugging at his
scanty beard. “But, as for his ghost coming back to
guard the house—I thought you’d better wits than that
Rebecca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle, hearing his shepherd’s voice, had come
down the passage; and, standing in the doorway, he
laughed suddenly. They were so much a part of Logie,
these two, with their friendly enmity and their strife of
tongues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s no time for laughing, if all I hear be true,” said
Brant, getting to his feet with a grim salute. “The
Wilderness Folk are ripe for any sort of mischief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, but it will get no further than their tongues.
I’m glad you’re here, though, Stephen. I’ve to ride
over the tops to Norbrigg, and shall go easier in
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ye go, Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’ve been dinning at him,” shrilled
Rebecca. “When a man takes a wife to himself, he’s
no right to go pleasuring abroad, with the Garsykes
muck at large.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re broken men, I tell you. You with a gun,
Brant, and Rebecca with her rolling-pin—you’re
enough to hold the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’re taking the mistress into it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taking her to the hill-winds. She’s stifled in these
Logie woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that he went down the corridor, buoyant and
heedless. A stable-lad was holding the two horses,
and Causleen waited for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brant’s here,” he said, as he mounted her. “It’s
as well, with Rebecca thinking fire and slaughter is
brewing up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed with him. Laughter was in their hearts,
and joy rode pick-a-back behind them down the winding
lane. The bird-cherry trees were in blossom, their
white tassels dusting the sleepy air with fragrance.
From every bush—from the high sycamores whose
leaves drowsed in the summer’s heat—birds were wild
with song. Thrushes piped high. Blackbirds sent out
their mellower note, and all the small fry joined in this
wild din of June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Causleen,” said Hardcastle, his voice softened by
the wonder of their days together, “I was surly
when you came at first. Dear God, if I had missed
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was not meant. Was there ever a wind that
blew but brought us closer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this mood—sure of each other, with a high
pride in wedlock—that they reached the gate opening
on the Norbrigg road. On the top bar lay a flint arrow,
brown and smooth in the sun-glare, and Hardcastle
checked himself as he stooped to unhasp the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His glance sought Causleen’s. Both were thinking
of the first token found by Pedlar Donald, of all that
followed. They were thinking, too, with sharp revulsion,
of the arrow-heads that littered the floor of
Garsykes Cave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment their nightmare journey through the
cavern clouded the sunlight, chilled the eager breath of
summer. Then Hardcastle put the token into his
pocket, as he had put the earlier one, and said not a word
as they rode up into the hills. It was only when they
drew rein to breathe their horses, and Garsykes showed
below them, that he broke the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go through no second waiting-time, wife,”
he said—“waiting for what the Wilderness is pleased to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Dick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brant would have found the Logie Men ready
enough to muster, if we’d been lost that day. They’ll
<span class='it'>have</span> to muster now, and we’ll make an end of the swine-styes
yonder, once for all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the strength of their great caring, from the
very heart of her bridal pride, joy quickened in Causleen.
Better war, savage and instant, than to go through
another stealthy siege at the hands of Garsykes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Break them outright, Dick,” she said. “For my
sake, break them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode up and further up into the wide-flung
spaces of the fells. No woodland birds sang here.
That lowland litany of joy was out of hearing. Instead,
there came the wheeling cries of hawk and plover,
red-shank and snipe and hoodie-crow—battle-music,
swift as a pibroch, keen as the thin, nipping wind that
fought the glaring sun-heat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Past Lone Rigg Cross they went—which marked the
graves of a lad found dead in some far-off winter’s gale—and
up raking Skircarl Rise, till they drew rein again
to give their sweating nags a rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were on the roof-top of the Dale now, Moorland
and gaunt pastures, gashed by wild ravines, raked to
the further mountains, grey-blue in the distant, shimmering
haze—a haze so drifting that it was hard to
know Pen-y-Gent’s long, sloping crest or Ingleborough’s
bluff, upstanding bulk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good land, to live or die for,” said Hardcastle,
all his love for this far-striding homeland finding voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reluctant to go, they gathered the reins at last and
were moving forward at a lagging pace when a traveller
came up from the Norbrigg side, over the steep brink
of the hill. He was so tall and lean, so quick and yet so
stumbling in his stride, that they wondered who he was,
and how he came there. The one moving thing on this
lone, empty road, he seemed forlorn, and yet gigantic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stopped as he neared them and touched a
greasy cap. “D’ye know a place called Garsykes?”
he asked. “It should be somewhere near by now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Hardcastle, with grim humour, “I know
a place called Garsykes. Do you want to get there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, quick as my legs will take me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle pointed the way for him, where the lazy
track curved down to the lowlands and the curling
smoke below. Then he took the arrow-head from his
pocket and tossed it into the man’s hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell them it comes from Logie,” he said, and rode
forward with Causleen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man stared after them for a moment, then fell
again into the lopping stride that carries tired legs far.
Between the heather and the benty lands he went, and
came to Garsykes’ cobbled street, and dropped heavily
on to the stone bench outside the inn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd was sitting there with a quart
mug at his elbow, and he glanced curiously at the newcomer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where might you be from?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger sat bunched-up, his sombre eyes staring
straight in front of him. “From York,” he said.
“There’s been a gaol delivery—and I’m one of the
delivered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a pull at my mug, lad. You’ve walked a tidy
bit too far, by the look o’ you. There, that’s better.
And what did they gaol you for, if a body might
ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sullen grin wrinkled the man’s face. “They said
it was for robbery on the highroad; but I knew better.
It was for letting myself be fool enough to be catched at
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd nodded with rough friendliness. “Garsykes
is just the spot for you. You can do as you like,
all up and down the country-side, and nobody dare
catch you at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard as much in gaol. So I stepped over and
down, and here I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd stirred uneasily as a little snatch of song
drifted down the street, and Nita Langrish came picking
her way daintily through the garbage and the litter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped at the sight of the stranger. Hope
never died in her that one day a strong man would come
from over the hill and help her lead her wastrels up to
Logie for the last, big fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murgatroyd watched her trying to weave filmy spells
about this new arrival—watched with the old, half-slumbering
lust to take her beauty by the throat and
end it—with the old, indolent zest, too, in seeing yet
another fall into her toils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger was past blandishment. All that York
gaol had done to him, all the road-sores under his feet
and the drumming anguish in his brain, seemed doubled
now that the need to keep going no longer spurred
him on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fumbled for his pipe and moleskin pouch, and
with them drew from his pocket a flint arrow-head that
tinkled on the cobble-stones. He did not heed, but
Nita saw it lying there and drew back as from a thing
she feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you find it?” she asked, her voice harsh
and shrill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That?” said the vagabond, glancing down. “I’d
forgotten it. It was given me by a big chap, striding a
big horse. He told me to carry it to Garsykes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lit his pipe with shaking fingers, pulled fiercely at
it for awhile, then threw it down and lay back on the
bench. The sweat dripped from him. His lean body
was shaken as with palsy, and his face was red and
ashen-grey by turns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not done yet,” he stammered, groping for the
pipe that was his first and last stand-by. “What sort
of fool should I be to give in just when I’m free of gaol?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd snarled at Nita, the basket-weaver.
“I told you how it would go,” he said, “when you
sent three of us to take Hardcastle at the pinfold. And
now here’s the token back. He knows he’s weathered
the worst of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Nita sharply. “There’ll be worse to
come—for Logie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lean-limbed stranger roused himself. Fever
glowed in his eyes and his voice was hoarse and wolfish.
“There’s always worse to come,” he said, and fell back,
the sweat pouring down his haggard face.</p>

<h3>THE PLAGUE</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle had sent his challenge to Garsykes
by the tramping man who met them on the
Norbrigg road, and was quick to follow the new
venture. The next day he rode with Causleen from
farm to farm, and found his tenantry alert for battle.
A changed mood had come to them. They knew
how nearly these two had been lost for ever to Logie-side.
They warmed to the hardihood of their escape
from the Garsykes cavern, to their bridal-gallop over to
Skipton and back and the keen, young mating look they
carried. And shame was on them to remember how
they had paid tribute to the skulking folk out yonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last farm they came to was Michael Draycott’s,
and they found him in the patch of garden fronting the
house. He was leaning on a stick—a sick man and an
old, till Hardcastle rallied him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dying again, Michael?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I wouldn’t say as much as that—though I
fancied last night the end had come. My innards were
that wambly you’d scarce believe till I settled them
with a dose of barley-brew. And now I’m getting
about again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose all Logie was for marching straight
through Garsykes street? How long should we have
to wait till you got well, Michael?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of three minutes—or maybe two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re always the same, Michael.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I couldn’t be different, so long as I’m inside
my body—like a bird in a cage, as you might say. Do
we bring guns with us, Master?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other’s face hardened. “We do—and we fire
Garsykes from end to end. There’s to be no quarter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s well thought out,” said Michael. “Their
thatched roofs will be like tinder in this heat that’s
come to the moor. Years out of mind I’ve wanted
that sort of clearance, and I hope we start to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would God we could,” said Hardcastle, with
stormy recollection of the cave—“but we’ve to make
our preparations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s no harm in giving them a taste of what
they put on us. You sent Garsykes the token. Now
they can wait, asking each other what’s to come. <span class='it'>And
naught will come</span>, till they fair get the dithers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Michael’s words stayed with Hardcastle, while he
conquered his own impatience during the next days.
Nothing was overlooked in his preparations for attack.
He would have less than fifty to lead against a village
that swarmed with men entrenched in their own walls.
The more need, he told himself, to see that each of his
had his weapons in good order and knew how to use
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was tedious work, but he remembered Causleen’s
appeal. “Break them outright, Dick,” she had said.
“For my sake, break them.” And he had checked his
first impulse, to attack at once. There must be no
mistake, no hot-headed leaping against odds that might
smother them. The Lost Folk should be broken, as she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drilled his men, mapped out each detail of the
coming fight. Aloof from any care except to make an
end of Garsykes—pitiless, save for the women and
children harbouring there—he lived for the one purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they drilled, the men growing restless to be
into Garsykes street, the sun blazed each day from a sky
that showed nowhere any cloud of mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s drying their thatches nicely,” Michael Draycott
would growl, with a glance across the valley. “Let’s
pray that no rain comes before the Master lets us loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now a rumour spread through the Logie country.
First it was whispered that a stranger had come into
Garsykes and died there of the plague. That was
sinister enough, but soon news followed of further
deaths, till dread took hold of all folk—a colder and a
stealthier dread than ever Garsykes brought on Logie
until now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle drilled his men relentlessly, to keep their
minds from brooding. The thicker the rumours spread,
the less he credited them. The Lost Folk, learning
somehow of the coming onslaught, had spread the news
themselves, and under its cover were preparing an
attack in force. This was what he told his people, and
by night they doubled the number of their scouts
about the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None was eager now, except the Master, to press
through Garsykes street; for the very name of plague
set each looking at another for the tell-tale blotches to
appear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a morning came when Hardcastle, looking
across the valley, saw a black shape hovering in the
molten sky. It was joined presently by another, and
yet another, and suddenly he understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can ease our drilling, Michael,” he said.
“Garsykes has not lied this once—for the corbie-crows
are waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Garsykes—those still alive in it—saw the same three
crows poised above its sweltering street. Rumour at
its wildest could have pictured no scene more stark
with horror; for the stranger who had brought Hardcastle’s
challenge had brought gaol-fever, too, and it
had spread like flame throughout a village ready to
receive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun beat down from the shelterless fells till the
cobbles of the street were hot to tread. Each festering
refuse heap bred flies beyond number, and in the roadway
lay the body of a man that none dared touch.
Gaol-fever, quick to strike, had taken him as he neared
home, and he had found no strength to journey further.
It was for him the corbies watched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As though havoc were not doing enough with them,
the Lost Folk let in another adversary—cringing and
abject fear—fear that slackened the muscles and slew
their will to live. Every other house was tenanted by
dead or dying, and those free of the plague as yet were
journeying up the fells with bundles slung over-shoulder.
It was better to go anywhere than stay in Garsykes,
where plague stalked silent through the buzzing flies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last fugitive to seek the hills was Widow Mathison,
and Nita was at her cottage-door as she came past
with her boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid, like the rest?” mocked the basket-weaver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for myself. I’d have stood by my tavern to
the last, but there’s the little lad to think of. Hardcastle
o’ Logie saved him from the bog, and ’twould be
a shame to let him die of Garsykes fever. You don’t
like Hardcastle’s name, I notice. He’s had the laugh
of us at the end of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With flaunting, half-frightened derision, she gripped
her boy’s hand, and together they went up the track of
flight that many Garsykes Folk had taken—the track
marked here and there, as they sped further up the
wilds, by some dying man who raved in anguish, or by a
dead woman with a baby crying at her breasts for food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nita looked down on the steamy haze of Garsykes.
Up here, where her cottage nestled in a dingle of the
highlands, the breeze blew clear and free. Death
might ride as he would through a village she despised
and loathed—but how could he touch little Nita, who
wove baskets for the Dale? She glanced far out to
Logie, its grey chimneys pushing up above the lush,
green woodlands. Hardcastle and his bride were there,
and already she was weaving snares for them, supple as
the willows that were her stock-in-trade, when a heavy
tread sounded close at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw Long Murgatroyd lurching and swaying up
the road—saw him steady himself as he neared her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were three of us left in Garsykes,” said Murgatroyd.
“And now there’s only two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is that?” asked Nita, humouring a man in
liquor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stepped into the widow’s for a drink of ale—hoping
she’d forget what she’d chalked on the inside o’
the door against me. And there wasn’t a widow there.
So I helped myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No need to tell me that,” said Nita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The widow’s gone up-fell, like the rest of the living
folk. And now there’s only you and me—and the still
ones down yonder. We’ve got all Garsykes to ourselves,
Nita, and the fever couldn’t touch us if it tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as he spoke, he fell to shivering, and Nita
glanced at him with startled eyes. The widow’s ale
had less to do with his wild talk and wilder bearing than
she had fancied. Doubt grew into certainty that the
plague was on him, and yet she could not stir. She
could only watch the dreadful twisting of his body, till
the shivering passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now we’ll set up together, and own all Garsykes,”
said Murgatroyd. “It will take us a bit to shift the
dead, but they’ll not hinder—and the fever can’t touch
us——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice wandered out in senseless mutterings.
Then, as he saw her recoil, a false strength came on him.
She had played with him, flouted him; but he had
known she would be his one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before she knew his purpose, he had crushed her into
his arms and kissed her, scarce knowing what he did.
Fighting like a wild-cat, tooth and claw, she got away
from his fast-waning strength, and fled up the hills, and
out to the hidden pool where she was used to bathe o’
mornings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stripped with haste and plunged into the peat-brown
depths, and scarce dared leave them when her
limbs grew chill and cramped. And in her heart, deep
down, was a haunting fear that not all the waters, welling
sweet from out these pastured uplands, could
cleanse that bridal-kiss of plague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long Murgatroyd tottered in pursuit, then came
near to falling. He forgot Nita, forgot all but the
instinct of a wounded beast to seek its lair. Somehow
he got to his cottage, and went in, and shut the door.
A great sweat broke over him, and afterwards a chill
that nipped him to the bone. He raked the grey peats
on the hearth into a glow, and fed them with sticks
and fir-cones till the chimney roared and bellowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he could find no warmth, though his brain was
hot as a furnace. He piled more wood on, and more,
till the blazing heap fell over and down, and licked his
clothes, and ran here and there about the coarse matting
on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca, up at Logie, had found no ease that day.
Scrub as she would, bake, or quarrel with the brindled
cat, nothing helped to stifle her restlessness. Old
griefs tugged at her memory, and would not be still.
Jealousy of Logie’s mistress rankled with new bitterness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was drawn out of doors at last. The workaday
present galled and fretted. Nothing would serve but
communion with her lover, such as she found only at
the gate down yonder—the lover who could not rest
in his grave because his death at Garsykes’ hands went
unrequited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before ever she reached the gate, a scud of thin,
harsh smoke came down the rising breeze. She glanced
in question across the valley that hid Wharfe River,
flaring under Logie Brigg—glanced up at old Pengables,
swarthy against the molten sky, and down again to the
hollow where Garsykes lay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rebecca caught her breath. Things hoped for, till
the heart grows sick, are not to be believed at first. Yet
soon she had to credit what was doing yonder. She
leaned a shoulder down for Jonah, and the cat leaped
nimbly up, spitting and growling at the wisps of
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’ye see it, lad?” she asked, pointing a skinny
finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where Garsykes lay, a running sheet of fire blazed up
into the sun-glare. It stayed for a moment to swallow
a cottage, then passed nimbly forward to the next.
The thatched roofs, one by one, broke upward in a
shower of wind-blown flame. And all about the land
there was the startled din of moor-birds, wheeling and
crying, afraid for their nestlings on the heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now God be thanked,” said Rebecca, young, happy
vigour in her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she fell into a trance. Forty years her man
had waited, coming to the gate each night to ask if
Garsykes swine still roamed the land. And now she
felt a hand steal into hers, content at last. And she
woke, as from a marriage-bed, with throstles singing
up the new-found dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m coming soon, my lad,”—her voice was soft and
girlish—“after I’ve settled two young lovers into Logie.
They don’t need Rebecca now.”</p>

<div><h1 id='chap26'>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<h3>“LOGIE’S DOUBLY SAFE”</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The weather broke that year in the middle of the
hay-harvest, and Hardcastle, riding with Causleen
to see what the past night’s rain had done
with the biggest of the upland meadows, knew that his
men could not get busy with it yet, though the sun
shone hot from a quiet and fleecy sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they gave themselves a holiday, and rode by many
a heather lane till they came at last to the moor-crest
guarded by Pengables’ rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A soft wind blew. Over the striding fells shadow
and sunlight chased each other like big children let
loose for play. They looked across to Weathersett,
grim even in this tender summer-time. And presently,
against their will, they glanced down at the hollow
where Garsykes once had stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunlight was merciless with the foul, unkempt
horror of this dead village that festered in its grave.
The ravens and the crows had taken their toll long since
of what lay in the street, and had gone to richer hunting-grounds.
No sound came from the fire-swept,
broken walls that leaned against each other like
drunkards tottering in a wild embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Causleen who broke the silence. “It will lie
like that for ever, Dick,” she said, with a shudder.
“They call it the plague-pit already, and none dare
enter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle roused himself from some harsh unrest.
There was an end of Garsykes, that had troubled Logie-side
for centuries out of mind. Yet he was not content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I planned to take our Logie Men, and make an
end,” he answered moodily. “There was the night
when Murgatroyd found us snow-bound in the hut.
If only for taking your name on their filthy tongues, I
wish it had been mine to kill and burn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must not—Dick, you must not think of it,”
she pleaded, her voice awed and shaken. “Is it not
enough—all that lies there? And you are safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still in a black mood, his glance wandered to the
hollow of the fells where Nita’s cottage sent up a
tranquil stream of smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>She</span> survives,” he said grimly. “When first the
rumour spread that she had taken the plague and come
through it, I fancied they had seen a ghost. Few take
it and live on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen shivered. The day’s warmth, the joy of
their wedded lives—the news that had trembled on her
lips as they drew rein on top of swart Pengables and the
thought of what these wide-flung acres meant to
Hardcastle—all went by. It was as if they stepped
together from eager sunlight into a pine-wood where
the breeze blew chill and shrewish and there was
darkness overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare she stay so near—how dare she, Dick,
with Garsykes festering below? Has she no wit to
understand that ghosts of the dead will creep up to her
cottage-door? She was their evil spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let her be,” broke in Hardcastle. “She goes
abroad with her face hidden when she sells her baskets
these days. They say her wits are gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray God they are,” said Causleen, bitter with
remembrance of the day when Nita had named her
light-of-love and wanton. “She needs forgetfulness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode down the fells together, man and wife;
but cold was on them, as if Garsykes still had power to
spin webs of dread about their feet. All that had been
gathered close—the slow months, while the Lost Folk
were doing their worst with Logie—the stealthy peril
of the caves, and their winning through into moonlit
liberty of Drumly Ghyll—and, after that, the plague
and fire that had swept Garsykes into a death that
could not sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Causleen longed to give her man the news she had for
him, and could not, though their horses whinnied from
sheer joy of the sunlight and the roving breeze that
blew from everywhere, packed with lane-side sweets
of elder-bloom and honeysuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they rounded the corner of the road, where it
turned sharply down to Crooning Water, they saw a
shrouded figure sitting on the grey parapet. The
slender fingers, browned by sun and wind, were nimble
at the basket-weaving, as of old, and Nita was singing
as she worked—singing one of the eerie ballads handed
down in Garsykes to keep warm their hate of Logie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew rein, Hardcastle and Causleen, appalled
by this venom that had survived her recovery from the
plague—survived the havoc of a village left derelict till
time ended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basket-weaver ceased her song. She drew the
hood down from her face, and laughed with dreadful
mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now they saw what the plague had done with her.
Her body was lissome as of old, her eyes full of nameless
witchery; but the shrunken face was grey and livid—a
dread, unsightly face best hidden from all passers-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My beauty’s gone, Hardcastle of Logie,” she said,
defiant to the last, “and there’s no Garsykes left. But
I still sell baskets up the Dale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come away,” pleaded Causleen. “Dick, come
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardcastle sat there in saddle for a moment, with
sharp recollection of other days, when Nita’s face was
a mask of eager beauty, tempting men. Then without
a word he rode on, Causleen beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the chill was on them, as if they had plunged
into a pine-wood where no free air could roam or wildflowers
grow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>She still sells baskets up the Dale</span>,” said Causleen,
awed and troubled. “You heard her, Dick? It was
a threat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come to Logie Brigg, and drew rein
there, listening to Wharfe River as she lapped
and played about the grey arches underneath.
And suddenly, as if the river sent up a message to
him in plain words, Hardcastle knew that he was
home at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An idle threat,” he said, his voice buoyant and
secure. “Garsykes is ended at long last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went together up the steep, winding road,
ablaze with sunlight and choired by singing birds, and
came to the gate of many memories. Twice the Garsykes
token had been laid on the topmost bar. Rebecca
had trysted her dead lover here, every night
through forty weary years. And remembrance of this
tryst gave Causleen heart to speak at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Logie and the lands are so much to you,” she said,
the words tripping over one another in their haste—“and
Rebecca could never be done with mourning
that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, wife? She was always good at the doldrums.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That Logie had no heir—and, Dick——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great light came into Hardcastle’s face. From
under lowered eyelids she watched it glow and deepen
like dawn above Pengables Hill. He was older and
younger both, and his voice a conqueror’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now Logie’s doubly safe,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the grey-boled sycamores above them, Logie’s
guardian rooks rose in a great, chattering cloud. They
and their fore-elders had nested here for generations
out of mind; and it seemed as if they, too, understood.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
